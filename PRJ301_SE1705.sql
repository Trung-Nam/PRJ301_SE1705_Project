Strangely  enough,  we  shall  suggest  as  one  of  ourchief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issuesselling  not  far  above  their  tangible-asset  value.*  The  reason  for  this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi-cal.  Experience  has  taught  us  that,  while  there  are  many  goodgrowth  companies  worth  several  times  net  assets,  the  buyer  ofsuch shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuationsof  the  stock  market.  By  contrast,  the  investor  in  shares,  say,  of  public-utility  companies  at  about  their  net-asset  value  can  alwaysconsider himself the owner of an INTerest in sound and expandingbusinesses,  acquired  at  a  rational  price—regardless  of  what  thestock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of sucha  conservative  policy  is  likely  to  work  out  better  than  excitingadventures INTo the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipatedgrowth.The art of investment has one characteristic that is not generallyappreciated.  A creditable,  if  unspectacular,  result  can  be  achievedby the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but toimprove  this  easily  attainable  standard  requires  much  applicationand more than a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring just alittleextra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investmentprogram, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, youmay well find that you have done worse.Since  anyone—by  just  buying  and  holding  a  representativelist—can  equal  the  performance  of  the  market  averages,  it  wouldseem a comparatively simple matter to “beat the averages”; but asa matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and failis  surprisingly  large.  Even  the  majority  of  the  investment  funds,with  all  their  experienced  personnel,  have  not  performed  so  wellWhat This Book Expects to Accomplish9* Tangible  assets  include  a  company’s  physical  property  (like  real  estate,factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial balances (suchas cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable). Among the ele-ments not included in tangible assets are brands, copyrights, patents, fran-chises,  goodwill,  and  trademarks.

over  the  years  as  has  the  general  market.  Allied  to  the  foregoing  is  the  record  of  the  published  stock-market  predictions  of  the  brokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculatedforecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossingof a coin.In  writing  this  book  we  have  tried  to  keep  this  basic  pitfall  ofinvestment  in  mind.  The  virtues  of  a  simple  portfolio  policy  havebeen emphasized—the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diver-sified list of leading common stocks—which any investor can carryout with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safeand  sound  territory  has  been  presented  as  fraught  with  challeng-ing  difficulties,  especially  in  the  area  of  temperament.  Beforeattempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himselfand  of  his  advisers—particularly  as  to  whether  they  have  a  clearconcept of the differences between investment and speculation andbetween market price and underlying value.A strong-minded  approach  to  investment,  firmly  based  on  themargin-of-safety  principle,  can  yield  handsome  rewards.  But  adecision  to  try  for  these  emoluments  rather  than  for  the  assuredfruits  of  defensive  investment  should  not  be  made  without  muchself-examination.A final  retrospective  thought.  When  the  young  author  enteredWall  Street  in  June  1914  no  one  had  any  inkling  of  what  the  nexthalf-century  had  in  store.  (The  stock  market  did  not  even  suspectthat a World War was to break out in two months, and close downthe New York Stock Exchange.) Now, in 1972, we find ourselves therichest and most powerful country on earth, but beset by all sortsof  major  problems  and  more  apprehensive  than  confident  of  thefuture.  Yet  if  we  confine  our  attention  to  American  investmentexperience,  there  is  some  comfort  to  be  gleaned  from  the  last  57years.  Through  all  their  vicissitudes  and  casualties,  as  earth-shaking  as  they  were  unforeseen,  it  remained  true  that  soundinvestment principles produced generally sound results. We mustact on the assumption that they will continue to do so.Note to the Reader:This book does not address itself to the overallfinancial  policy  of  savers  and  investors;  it  deals  only  with  that  portion  of  their  funds  which  they  are  prepared  to  place  in  mar-ketable  (or  redeemable)  securities,  that  is,  in  bonds  and  stocks.10INTroductionwww.fx1618.com

COMMENTARY ON THE INTRODUCTIONIf you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost;that is where they should be. Now put the foundations underthem.—Henry David Thoreau,WaldenNotice that Graham announces from the start that this book will nottell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can.Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:•how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;•how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;•how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps mostinvestors from reaching their full potential.Back in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocksseemed  to  be  doubling  in  value  every  day,  the  notion  that  you  couldlose almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002,many of the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95% of their valueor more. Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900%just  to  get  back  to  where  you  started.1Taking  a  foolish  risk  can  putyou so deep in the hole that it’s virtually impossible to get out. That’swhy  Graham  constantly  emphasizes  the  importance  of  avoidinglosses—not just in Chapters 6, 14, and 20, but in the threads of warn-ing that he has woven throughout his entire text.But  no  matter  how  careful  you  are,  the  price  of  your  investmentswillgo down from time to time. While no one can eliminate that risk,121To put this statement in perspective, consider how often you are likely tobuy a stock at $30 and be able to sell it at $600.www.fx1618.com
Commentary on the INTroduction13Graham  will  show  you  how  to  manage  it—and  how  to  get  your  fearsunder control.ARE YOU AN INTELLIGENT INVESTOR?Now let’s answer a vitally important question. What exactly does Gra-ham mean by an “INTelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of thisbook, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind ofINTelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply meansbeing patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able toharness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of INTelligence,explains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the brain.”2There’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough tomake an investor INTelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital ManagementL.P.,  a  hedge  fund  run  by  a  battalion  of  mathematicians,  computer  scientists,  and  two  Nobel  Prize–winning  economists,  lost  more  than  $2  billion  in  a  matter  of  weeks  on  a  huge  bet  that  the  bond  marketwould return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becomingmore  and  more  abnormal—and  LTCM  had  borrowed  so  much  moneythat its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.3And back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares INThe  South  Sea  Company,  the  hottest  stock  in  England.  Sensing  thatthe market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered thathe  “could  calculate  the  motions  of  the  heavenly  bodies,  but  not  themadness of the people.” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-eting a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up INThe wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a muchhigher  price—and  lost  £20,000  (or  more  than  $3  million  in  today’smoney). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words“South Sea” in his presence.42Benjamin Graham, The INTelligent Investor(Harper & Row, 1949), p. 4.3A “hedge fund” is a pool of money, largely unregulated by the government,invested  aggressively  for  wealthy  clients.  For  a  superb  telling  of  the  LTCMstory, see Roger Lowenstein, When Genius Failed(Random House, 2000).4John  Carswell,  The  South  Sea  Bubble(Cresset  Press,  London,  1960),pp.  131,  199.  Also  see  www.harvard-magazine.com/issues/mj99/damnd.html.www.fx1618.com
Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most INTelligent people who everlived, as most of us would define INTelligence. But, in Graham’s terms,Newton was far from an INTelligent investor. By letting the roar of thecrowd override his own judgment, the world’s greatest scientist actedlike a fool.In short, if you’ve failed at investing so far, it’s not because you’restupid. It’s because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven’t developed theemotional  discipline  that  successful  investing  requires.  In  Chapter  8,Graham  describes  how  to  enhance  your  INTelligence  by  harnessingyour emotions and refusing to stoop to the market’s level of irrational-ity. There you can master his lesson that being an INTelligent investor ismore a matter of “character” than “brain.”A CHRONICLE OF CALAMITYNow let’s take a moment to look at some of the major financial devel-opments of the past few years:1.    The  worst  market  crash  since  the  Great  Depression,  with  U.S.stocks  losing  50.2%  of  their  value—or  $7.4  trillion—betweenMarch 2000 and October 2002.2.    Far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies ofthe  1990s,  including  AOL,  Cisco,  JDS  Uniphase,  Lucent,  andQualcomm—plus  the  utter  destruction  of  hundreds  of  INTernetstocks.3.    Accusations of massive financial fraud at some of the largest andmost  respected  corporations  in  America,  including  Enron,  Tyco,and Xerox.4.    The  bankruptcies  of  such  once-glistening  companies  as  Con-seco, Global Crossing, and WorldCom.5.    Allegations  that  accounting  firms  cooked  the  books,  and  evendestroyed records, to help their clients mislead the investing public.6.    Charges  that  top  executives  at  leading  companies  siphoned  offhundreds of millions of dollars for their own personal gain.7.Proof that security analysts on Wall Street praised stocks publiclybut admitted privately that they were garbage.8.    A  stock  market  that,  even  after  its  bloodcurdling  decline,  seemsovervalued  by  historical  measures,  suggesting  to  many  expertsthat stocks have further yet to fall.14Commentary on the INTroductionwww.fx1618.com
9.  A relentless decline in INTerest rates that has left investors with noattractive alternative to stocks.10.  An investing environment bristling with the unpredictable menaceof global terrorism and war in the Middle East.Much  of  this  damage  could  have  been  (and  was!)  avoided  byinvestors  who  learned  and  lived  by  Graham’s  principles.  As  Grahamputs  it,  “while  enthusiasm  may  be  necessary  for  great  accomplish-ments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.”By  letting  themselves  get  carried  away—on  INTernet  stocks,  on  big“growth” stocks, on stocks as a whole—many people made the samestupid  mistakes  as  Sir  Isaac  Newton.  They  let  other  investors’  judg-ments determine their own. They ignored Graham’s warning that “thereally  dreadful  losses”  always  occur  after  “the  buyer  forgot  to  ask‘How  much?’ ”  Most  painfully  of  all,  by  losing  their  self-control  justwhen they needed it the most, these people proved Graham’s asser-tion  that  “the  investor’s  chief  problem—and  even  his  worst  enemy—islikely to be himself.”THE SURE THING THAT WASN’TMany of those people got especially carried away on technology andINTernet  stocks,  believing  the  high-tech  hype  that  this  industry  wouldkeep outgrowing every other for years to come, if not forever:•In  mid-1999,  after  earning  a  117.3%  return  in  just  the  first  fivemonths  of  the  year,  Monument  INTernet  Fund  portfolio  managerAlexander Cheung predicted that his fund would gain 50% a yearover  the  next  three  to  five  years  and  an  annual  average  of  35%“over the next 20 years.”5Commentary on the INTroduction155Constance Loizos, “Q&A: Alex Cheung,” InvestmentNews,May 17, 1999,p. 38. The highest 20-year return in mutual fund history was 25.8% per year,achieved  by  the  legendary  Peter  Lynch  of  Fidelity  Magellan  over  the  twodecades ending December 31, 1994. Lynch’s performance turned $10,000INTo more than $982,000 in 20 years. Cheung was predicting that his fundwould turn $10,000 INTo more than $4 million over the same length of time.Instead of regarding Cheung as ridiculously overoptimistic, investors threwwww.fx1618.com
•After  his  Amerindo  Technology  Fund  rose  an  incredible  248.9%in  1999,  portfolio  manager  Alberto  Vilar  ridiculed  anyone  whodared  to  doubt  that  the  INTernet  was  a  perpetual  moneymakingmachine:  “If  you’re  out  of  this  sector,  you’re  going  to  underper-form.  You’re  in  a  horse  and  buggy,  and  I’m  in  a  Porsche.  You  don’t  like  tenfold  growth  opportunities?  Then  go  with  someoneelse.”6•In  February  2000,  hedge-fund  manager  James  J.  Cramer  pro-claimed that INTernet-related companies “are the only ones worthowning right now.” These “winners of the new world,” as he calledthem,  “are  the  only  ones  that  are  going  higher  consistently  ingood days and bad.” Cramer even took a potshot at Graham: “Youhave to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts thatexisted before the Web. . . . If we used any of what Graham andDodd teach us, we wouldn’t have a dime under management.”7All these so-called experts ignored Graham’s sober words of warn-ing:  “Obvious  prospects  for  physical  growth  in  a  business  do  nottranslate  INTo  obvious  profits  for  investors.”  While  it  seems  easy  toforesee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no realvalue if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. Bythe time everyone decides that a given industry is “obviously” the best16Commentary on the INTroductionmoney  at  him,  flinging  more  than  $100  million  INTo  his  fund  over  the  nextyear.  A  $10,000  investment  in  the  Monument  INTernet  Fund  in  May  1999would  have  shrunk  to  roughly  $2,000  by  year-end  2002.  (The  Monumentfund  no  longer  exists  in  its  original  form  and  is  now  known  as  OrbitexEmerging Technology Fund.)6Lisa Reilly Cullen, “The Triple Digit Club,” Money,December, 1999, p. 170.If you had invested $10,000 in Vilar’s fund at the end of 1999, you wouldhave  finished  2002  with  just  $1,195  left—one  of  the  worst  destructions  ofwealth in the history of the mutual-fund industry.7See   www.thestreet.com/funds/smarter/891820.html.   Cramer’s   favoritestocks did not go “higher consistently in good days and bad.” By year-end2002, one of the 10 had already gone bankrupt, and a $10,000 investmentspread  equally  across  Cramer’s  picks  would  have  lost  94%,  leaving  youwith a grand total of $597.44. Perhaps Cramer meant that his stocks wouldbe “winners” not in “the new world,” but in the world to come.www.fx1618.com
one to invest in, the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high thatits future returns have nowhere to go but down.For now at least, no one has the gall to try claiming that technologywill  still  be  the  world’s  greatest  growth  industry.  But  make  sure  youremember this: The people who now claim that the next “sure thing”will be health care, or energy, or real estate, or gold, are no more likelyto be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to be.THE SILVER LININGIf  no  price  seemed  too  high  for  stocks  in  the  1990s,  in  2003  we’vereached  the  poINT  at  which  no  price  appears  to  be  low  enough.  Thependulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrationalexuberance to unjustifiable pessimism. In 2002, investors yanked $27billion out of stock mutual funds, and a survey conducted by the Secu-rities Industry Association found that one out of 10 investors had cutback on stocks by at least 25%. The same people who were eager tobuy stocks in the late 1990s—when they were going up in price and,therefore,  becoming  expensive—sold  stocks  as  they  went  down  inprice and, by definition, became cheaper.As  Graham  shows  so  brilliantly  in  Chapter  8,  this  is  exactly  back-wards. The INTelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their pricesfall. The INTelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocksmore costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cashon  hand  to  meet  your  spending  needs),  you  should  welcome  a  bearmarket, since it puts stocks back on sale.8So  take  heart:  The  death  of  the  bull  market  is  not  the  bad  newseveryone believes it to be. Thanks to the decline in stock prices, nowis  a  considerably  safer—and  saner—time  to  be  building  wealth.  Readon, and let Graham show you how.Commentary on the INTroduction178The  only  exception  to  this  rule  is  an  investor  in  the  advanced  stage  ofretirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market. Yet even anelderly  investor  should  not  sell  her  stocks  merely  because  they  have  gonedown in price; that approach not only turns her paper losses INTo real onesbut deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit those stocks at lower costsfor tax purposes.www.fx1618.com
CHAPTER 1Investment versus Speculation: Results toBe Expected by the INTelligent InvestorThis  chapter  will  outline  the  viewpoINTs  that  will  be  set  forth  INThe remainder of the book. In particular we wish to develop at theoutset  our  concept  of  appropriate  portfolio  policy  for  the  individ-ual, nonprofessional investor.Investment versus SpeculationWhat  do  we  mean  by  “investor”?  Throughout  this  book  theterm will be used in contradistinction to “speculator.” As far backas 1934, in our textbook Security Analysis,1we attempted a preciseformulation  of  the  difference  between  the  two,  as  follows:  “Aninvestment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom-ises  safety  of  principal  and  an  adequate  return.  Operations  notmeeting these requirements are speculative.”While  we  have  clung  tenaciously  to  this  definition  over  theensuing  38  years,  it  is  worthwhile  noting  the  radical  changes  thathave occurred in the use of the term “investor” during this period.After  the  great  market  decline  of  1929–1932  allcommon  stockswere widely regarded as speculative by nature. (A leading author-ity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment.2)Thus we had then to defend our definition against the charge thatit gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.Now  our  concern  is  of  the  opposite  sort.  We  must  prevent  ourreaders from accepting the common jargon which applies the term“investor”  to  anybody  and  everybody  in  the  stock  market.  In  ourlast edition we cited the following headline of a front-page articleof our leading financial journal in June 1962:18www.fx1618.com

This paper argues   that  recent  insights   in   psychology  and  cognitive  science   support  and   extend  GTD’s recommendations.  We   first   summarize   GTD with the help of a  flowchart.   We   then review the theories of situated,   embodied  and   distributed  cognition  that  purport  to   explain  how  the   brain processes information and plans actions in the real world. The conclusion is that the brain heavily relies on the environment, to function as an external memory, a trigger for actions, and a source of affordances, disturbances  and   feedback.   We  then   show  how  these   principles  are   practically implemented in GTD, with its focus on organizing tasks INTo “actionable” external memories, and on  opportunistic,  situation-dependent  execution.  Finally,   we propose   an extension   of GTD   to support collaborative work, inspired by the concept of stigmergy.Keywords:   personal   productivity,   personal   information   management,   time   management,   task management, praxeology, situated and embodied cognition, stigmergy, information overload.1
1. INTroductionOur  present society is characterized by  quickly growing complexity  and   change: opportunities, constraINTs, and objectives are in a constant flux. Managing the situation requires gathering and processing an incessant stream of potentially relevant information. As such, most of our day-to-day   activities   fall  under  the   heading   of  knowledge  work  (Drucker,  1973).   But   how   can  we efficiently   organize   such   heavily   information-dependent   work?   While   there   is   a   large   and established   literature   on   how   to   organize  traditional   physical   activities,   such  as   industrial processes,  the  literature  on   knowledge  management  is  as  yet  much  less  well  developed,  and mostly concerns the static storage and reuse of existing knowledge rather than the processing of incoming  information.  The  extensive  literature   on information   processing, on   the other   hand, mostly concerns computer systems rather than human information processing. Some   aspects   of   human   information   processing,   such   as   decision-making,   project planning and problem solving, have been well investigated. However, the corresponding theories are not really helpful to cope with the information explosion, since they generally assume a given range of possibilities from which the best  possible one is to be chosen. However, in a situation where new information may arrive by the minute, both the relevant options and the criteria for deciding   between   them   are   constantly   changing.   This   makes   formal   optimization   methods basically   useless   in   day-to-day   knowledge   work.   As   Simon   (1997)   poINTed   out   long   ago, rationality is bounded: we never have the full information needed to make optimal choices. But   Simon’s   alternative   strategy   of   “satisficing”   is   flawed   too:   a   choice   that   is satisfactory now, may not appear so good anymore when new information comes in. In practice, people follow a strategy of “bettering”: choosing what seems best from the available options now, but being ready to switch to something  better when new information arrives. This opportunistic mode of   decision-making   is   pervasive   in   today’s   fast-paced   and  uncertain  world. However, its lack of a clear focus makes it likely that people would not really know what to aim for, what to do, and what not to do. Moreover, the constant bombardment with new information means  that previous plans, decisions and relevant data are often forgotten or neglected. The last  two decades have seen an explosion of methods for “time management”, “task management”,   or  “personal  productivity   enhancement”  that   try  to  teach   knowledge   workers efficient routines for dealing with this overload of ever changing demands (e.g. Covey, Merrill & Merrill,  1994).   Most of   the recommendations   concern concrete   tools and   techniques, such   as installing spam filters, using personal organizers, sharing calendars, etc. Insofar that they look at the wider  picture, however, they tend to remain within the optimization paradigm: they suggest first   to   formulate  clear   objectives   or  priorities  (optimization   criteria),   and  then  to   order  the different tasks according  to (a) how  much they contribute to the priorities, (b) how much time, effort or other resources you need to invest in them. The recommendation is then to focus on the tasks that contribute maximally to the chosen objectives while requiring minimal resources. Although this strategy may seem self-evident, it does not take INTo account the fact that for   knowledge  work  both  priorities   and  resources  are   in   general   ill   defined  and  constantly changing. The reason is that information, unlike material resources, is not a conserved quantity: it can appear (be discovered or communicated) or disappear (become outdated) at any moment. For example,  an  engineer   planning  the  construction   of  a  bridge  can  be   pretty  confident  that   the amount of concrete and steel   necessary   for   the  construction   will  not   suddenly  change.  On   the other hand, an author planning to write a book about how to use this great new communication software may suddenly find out that the software has a fatal security flaw, or that another writer  has just  finished a comprehensive treatment of  the same subject. If that author had planned  her complete  work   schedule around   the book   project, she   would have   to  start   her planning   from scratch.  More  generally,  applying  an  optimization  strategy   to   knowledge  work   may  produce rather than reduce stress, as people worry about what priorities to accord to different alternatives, 2
and then feel guilty or disoriented when they have not managed to follow their own prescriptions because of unforeseen changes.The personal productivity consultant David Allen (2001) has proposed a fundamentally different approach. Based on years of experience in teaching knowledge workers how to deal with their backlog of unprocessed issues, the method is known as “Getting Things Done”, or GTD for short. GTD is INTended to  minimize   stress   and  anxiety   while   maximizing  productivity—in the sense   of   maximizing  the   number   of  useful  tasks   performed,   not  in  the  sense  of   maximally achieving  a given objective.  The  method has become remarkably popular in  a very short  time. According to the  Amazon web bookshop, in October 2007 Allen’s book ranked number one in the bestseller lists for both the domains “time management” and “business: health and stress”. At  the   same  time,  a  search  via  Google  found   more  than  a  million  web  pages  referring   to  this methodology. Numerous software   applications  and   adaptations  of  existing software have   been created to help people implement GTD in their daily life (Wikipedia contributors, 2007). In spite of the many testimonials that GTD works in practice, however, as yet no academic papers have investigated this method. A search (October 2007) for articles referring to (Allen, 2001) turned up a mere 14 documents, none of which discusses the method in any detail. The  present   paper INTends to fill this   gap   in the scientific literature. While  it   would be INTeresting to test GTD empirically, e.g. by comparing the productivity of people using GTD with the one of people using different methods, this is INTrinsically difficult. The reason is that because GTD does not embrace explicit priorities or optimization criteria, there is no obvious standard by which  to  measure   expected   productivity  enhancements.   A   simpler   approach   may  be  subjective evaluation: how   satisfied  with their work are  GTD  users compared to users of   other methods? However, this will  still teach us little about precisely how  and why GTD is supposed  to work. The present approach has chosen to address this last issue from a theoretical angle, starting from recent insights in cognitive science and cybernetics. We wish to view GTD and its proposed theoretical foundation  as a first  step towards a concrete  praxeology,  i.e.  a  theory   of  practical  action,  with   specific  application to  knowledge work.   A   praxeology   has   been  recognized   by   the   philosopher   Leo   Apostel   as   one   of   the fundamentals  components of a  worldview (Aerts  et  al., 1994).  Such a theory is independent  of any specific goals or values: these are chosen by the individuals performing the actions. In GTD, however, the  implicit value is to maximize productivity, i.e. to do more (tasks) with less  (time, effort, resources). In our   present information   society, mental   resources in   particular tend   to  be strained. Indeed, in Simon’s (1971, p. 40) memorable phrase, “a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention”. Given that the amount of attention that we can devote to our work is finite, a growing amount of information clamoring for our attention must at a certain moment produce an overload, where a   number of   (potentially important)  items  simply can   no  longer be  processed.  GTD is INTended to facilitate this unavoidable  process of selectively ignoring  demands while  remaining maximally in control of the situation. Although the method is rooted in practical experience, we will try to show that its success can be justified on the basis of solid theoretical foundations. To do that, we will need to review what the most recent theories about cognition and the brain tell us about information processing  in   the  real   world—as  opposed   to an abstract realm   of   logic  and rationality. But first we need to outline the basic principles of GTD.3
2. The GTD method: summaryGTD is a simple and flexible method for managing your day-to-day tasks or activities, so as to maximize  personal productivity.  The INTended  result of  applying GTD  is being  able to keep up with a high workflow in a relaxed manner. The main principle is to get everything that is nagging you out  of   your  mind  and INTo a   trusted  external  memory  (file system), so   that  you  can  stay focused   on   what   you   actually   have   to   do  now,   rather   than  on   various   ideas,   plans  and commitments for later. To achieve this, GTD provides a compilation of tips and tools, organized around a central   flowchart,   as  depicted in Fig.  1.   Organized people will   certainly  already  use calendars, to-do lists, note-taking devices, and other tools. What GTD adds, however, is a method for using those tools systematically together. Allen distinguishes five basic stages in our work:We (1) collect things that command our attention; (2) process what they mean and what to do with them; and (3) organize the results, which we (4) review as options for what we choose to (5) do. (Allen, 2001, 24)Collect (1) The first phase is to collect  everything that catches your attention as potentially relevant to your activities, whatever its subject, importance or degree of urgency. This includes incoming letters, emails,  phone  calls,  reports, articles   from  magazines,  agenda  items, suggestions   and  requests from other people, and personal ideas and memories. For the collecting process, you need one or more collection tools, which can be physical (trays, folders, notebook, etc.), or electronic (email application,  outliner,  or word processor,  on a computer  or a PDA).  These together define  your “in-basket”. Collection is just the first step: to gain control over the collected materials, you need to empty the in-basket regularly. Emptying means deciding what to do  with—not actually doing—the items in the collection. This happens by processing and organizing the items one by one.Process (2) & Organize (3)The processing and organizing phases are summarized in the flowchart (Fig.1).  4
Figure 1: a flowchart depicting the GTD process for organizing and processing incoming “stuff” INTo action  categories  (elaborated from  (Allen, 2001,  p.  32)). Rectangles  represent actions,  diamonds represent decision  poINTs,  stacks  represent external  memories  (lists,  folders,  files,  …) in  which reminders are stored. Continuous  arrows  represent  the  immediate  sequence  of  processing;  broken arrows represent delayed processing, during a review of an external memory; dotted lines represent follow-up processes left implicit in GTD, but whose importance will become clear in the explanation of Fig. 2. The process starts by taking one item out of the In-basket (top-left), and then follows the arrows depending on the answers to the questions. It ends when the item is classified in an external memory or the corresponding action is performed. The most important actions are likely to end up on the bottom-right.5
The sequence   of  decisions to  be  made starts   from the  top  left of   the  flowchart and   proceeds downwards. The first question to ask is: “What is this stuff?” Note that “stuff” is a catchall word, which can refer to an  email,  something at the back  of your  mind, a note,  a voice-mail, a scrap from a newspaper, etc., i.e. any item that has been collected. More precisely, the crucial question is: “Is it actionable?”, i.e. does it require you to perform an action?•if it is not actionable, there are three possibilities:oeliminate the item if you really will not use it (i.e. throw it in the trash bin); oincubate  the   item   for   possible   implementation   later   (i.e.   store   it   in   a Someday/maybe file that you will review at a later time); oreference the item if it does not require action but may need to be consulted later (i.e. store  it   in a  Reference  file, which   is  organized so that   items are  easy   to classify and retrieve).•if it is actionable, then you have to decide, “What is the next physical action?” oif there is more than one action required, store it in your Projects list.oif the action requires less than two minutes, it is not worth the effort of entering it INTo the system: better perform it immediately. oif you  are   not   the   best   person to do it, delegate the action to a more qualified person/organization, and keep track of whether you get back the desired result by entering a note in the Waiting for file. oif the action is to be done on a particular day and time, defer it to this moment, and note it on your Calendar. oif the  only time constraINT is that  you should do  it as soon as you can, put it  in your Next actions file. When you review your Projects list, for each project you should start developing a Project plan. This in general does not mean a formal scheme with milestones, deadlines and objectives, but a formulation  of the  overall   goal  or  desired   outcome,   with  a  focus   on  the  list  of   next  actions required  to   move towards this goal. Once   these  actions are defined, they  need   to be reviewed, which means that they should follow the part of the flowchart that describes the decision tree for actionable items. There is in general no need to plan actions far ahead: once the first “next action” is done, the next “next action” will probably become obvious. To make this summary more concrete, table I shows an example of  a very simple GTD list of reminders arranged in their appropriate categories. Note that items are susceptible to move from one category to another. For example, the item “plane tickets for Brussels” was initially in the Project Plan “Travel to Belgium”, reminding you to order the tickets; now you are Waiting for them to arrive by post; if they don’t arrive, it will become a Next Action to call the company about the tickets; after you have used them, you may store the tickets as a Reference, so that later you could potentially use them as proof of expenses made.6

The  daily review includes reviewing first your Calendar (which are the things that you have to do imperatively on this day?), and then your  Next actions  list (which are the things  that you should do as soon as practicable?).  The  weekly review  is  a   more in-depth review of all your  (potentially)  actionable files (In-basket, Calendar, Next actions, Projects, Project plans, Waiting for, Calendar and Someday/maybe). It is essential to get an overview of what has to be done in the coming period, and thus get the feeling of being in control.  Concretely,   it   means   that  you   make   sure   that   the different files in your external memory are kept up-to-date. This will include a complete cleaning of your desk, email, and other collection places, and thus some further processing and organizing according to the flowchart. A regular  review   is important in   order  to  develop  and  maINTain genuine trust   in  your system. Most people  who are not  applying GTD do this  kind of review  a few times a year, for example at the beginning of a new year. This gives them a great feeling of clarity, control, and purpose. These good INTentions, however, quickly dissipate when new, unprocessed things start to accumulate, and previous plans become outdated because of changing circumstances or lack of follow-up. If they would do such a review systematically every week, this feeling of control and goal-directedness could become permanent. Do (5)Having all your lists of to-dos up-to-date, what should you do right now? Allen proposes three models for deciding  which action to  perform. The  first is  the “four-criteria model  for choosing 7
actions in the moment”, which advises that you consider the following factors in the listed order:1. Context: What can you do here  and now?  You cannot do the same actions  when you are at your desk as when you are walking in the street. The context limits your choices to the tasks you can  (practically)  perform.  If you have a large number of “next actions”, it  is   recommended   to classify them   by context   (“office”,  “home”, “errant”,   etc.),  so that   actions  requiring the   same context can easily be performed together. 2.  Time available: How much  time do you have  now? Fit the duration  of the next action  you choose to the amount of time available: if the time is limited, do only short actions.3.  Energy  available:   How much   energy  do you   have at   this  moment? Adapt   your  choice of action to your level of physical and mental energy: when  you are tired do only routine actions, and keep difficult actions for when you feel more energetic.4.  Priority: What are  your   priorities?  Given the context,  the   time  and  energy  available,  what action should be done first? The two following models help you to answer that question. The “threefold model for evaluating daily work” proposes the following possible strategies:(1) Do work as it shows up(2) Do predefined work(3) Define your workIs the work that shows up (1) the most urgent thing you have to do? When you accomplish tasks as they appear (answering a phone call, chatting with a colleague passing by, replying to an email that just arrived,   etc.)   by  default it means   that  you   are  deciding  that  these   tasks  are  the  most  important ones at this moment. Alternatively, you can decide, if possible, to postpone the work that shows up, in order to focus on your predefined work (2). This means that you systematically go through your Next actions list. If you do not have any next actions listed, or if you do not feel confident that the listed “next action” is the best thing to do, you have to  define your work  (3). This is similar to the reviewing phase, where you clear your mind by updating your system of to-dos. Still, to be confident that what you are doing is truly important, you need a deeper insight in your general goals and values. The “six-level model for reviewing your own work” can support such clarification. Allen uses an airplane analogy to define the levels (Allen, 2001, p. 51):- 50, 000+ feet: Life- 40, 000 feet: Three- to five-year vision- 30, 000 feet: One- or two-year goals- 20, 000 feet: Areas of responsibility- 10, 000 feet: Current projects- Runway: Current actionsYou can   define goals   for  different  terms  or  time-spans,  from  tasks  to  undertake  immediately (Runway) to missions that extend over the rest of your life span (Life). The latter require you to answer  almost  philosophical  questions,  like  “What  is   my purpose   in life?”   It is   important  to engage from time to time in this “vertical thinking” (Allen, 2001, p.  20-21), and write down and review those lists of goals, so as not to be constantly chasing priorities at the runway level. 8
3. Cognitive foundations of knowledge workKnowledge work   consists of   various  forms  of  human  information  processing,  which  includes such  activities  as   data  gathering,  INTerpretation,   classification,  problem  solving,   and  decision-making.  These   mental   processes  have been studied since the 1950’s  by  cognitive   science (e.g. Luger, 1994; Thagard, 2005). Limitations of symbolic cognitionInitially,   the   guiding   metaphor   for   analyzing   cognitive   processes   was   the   manipulation   of symbols according   to   a complex program or algorithm. This led  to   the  symbolic  paradigm for cognition. Its basic   assumption  is   that  knowledge  is   an  abstract,  INTernal representation  of   the external environment. The main task of cognition is to solve problems, i.e. answer queries about that   environment  and  design   plans   to  achieve   goals   in  that   environment.   This  is   done   by manipulating the elements (symbols) of the representation according to given inference  rules in  order to  find   the  combination that best   solves  the  problem. The  symbolic   paradigm  thus  sees reasoning, planning and (bounded) rationality as the essence of cognition.The symbolic paradigm was   implemented  in   artificial  INTelligence (AI), a general   approach   to simulate cognitive processes  by means  of computer programs. However,  symbolic AI has been much   less   successful   than   expected—in   particular   in   terms   of   reproducing   actual   human performance. In contrast to the logical reasoning of AI programs, people’s reactions are based on INTuition, which is rooted in their subjective experience of the situation. This makes them much more flexible in dealing with complex and unforeseen circumstances. In part as a result of these failures, the symbolic view of cognition has come under harsh criticism over the past two decades (e.g.   Bickhard   &  Terveen,  1996;  Clancey,   1997;  Suchman,   1990).   It  has   now   been  largely overtaken by a “new” cognitive science, which is inspired more by the concrete functioning of the human mind (biologically, neurologically, psychologically, socially) than by abstract theories of logic and computation. One fundamental criticism   of   symbolic theories is  that   if  you   try  to represent all   the   relevant aspects of the real world with symbols, your representation becomes much too complex to be systematically explored  by a computer, and  a fortiori  by  the human brain.  Indeed,   the brain is limited by the famous “magical number seven” (Miller, 1956): not more than about seven items can be   held  simultaneously in   working memory.   A  sufficiently detailed   description of   a  real-world situation will typically include hundreds of symbols (words, concepts, features) that can be combined  in  millions  of  different  ways, making  it  essentially impossible  to  manipulate  these symbols in order to systematically explore all their potentially relevant combinations. Instead,  the brain relies on its long-term memory,  which can  store millions of  facts, to quickly recognize patterns  in the  incoming   information.  Recognized  patterns  function   as  stimuli  that trigger appropriate responses or actions. Unlike a computer program, the neural network structure of   the   brain  is  very   good  at  identifying   patterns,   at  associating  perceived   patterns   with  the appropriate actions, and at storing patterns and associations in long-term memory. However, it is very  poor  at  simultaneously   keeping  several  such  patterns  actively  in  mind   while  reasoning, because   the   corresponding   patterns   of   neural   activation   tend   to   INTerfere   with   each   other. Moreover, activation quickly decays because of diffusion and neuronal fatigue. Finally, while long-term memory is very effective at  recognition, it  is rather poor at recall, i.e. reviving memory patterns  without   perceptual  stimulation.   This  is  illustrated  by   the   “tip  of  the tongue” phenomenon, where a fact, such as a colleague’s name, cannot be recalled—even though you  know  the  memory  is  there.  In  that  sense,  human  memory  is  much  less  reliable  than  a computer memory for retrieving a fact outside  of the concrete context that reminds  you of that fact.9
Situated and Embodied CognitionOne of the key insights of the new cognitive science is that cognition is necessarily situated and embodied  (Clark,  1997,   1999;  Clancey,   1997;  Anderson   &   Michael,  2003).   This  means   that   a cognitive system, such as the human mind, is always INTeracting with its environmental situation via its bodily  sensors (eyes, ears, touch…) that perceive, and  effectors (hands, vocal chords…) that  produce  actions.  The  complexity  of  the   real  world  is  dealt  with  not  by  manipulating  an abstract INTernal representation,  but by manipulating the world itself,  i.e. by  performing actions and  monitoring  their  results   via   perceptions.  This INTeraction  is   controlled   via  sensory-motor feedback: •perceptions trigger actions; •actions produce changes in the environmental situation; •these changes are again perceived, •these perceptions trigger new actions to—if necessary—correct or extend the effects  of the previous actions. Different  situations  will   produce different   perceptions,  and  therefore  trigger different   actions. Both cognition and action therefore are situated: they are determined much more by the concrete external situation than by INTernal reasoning or planning (Suchman, 1990; Susi & Ziemke, 2001; Clancey, 1997). This  shifts most of the burden of memory  and reasoning from the brain  to the environment:  instead  of  having  to  conceive,  predict  and  remember the   potential results   of an action,   the   action   is   simply   executed   so   that   its   actual   results   can   be   read   off   from   the environmental situation.Effective actions leave their mark on the environment. Insofar that this mark is made in a stable medium,  such   as stone, paper or  silicon,   it  functions like an objective registration  of  what has happened, storing the information for   later   inspection   by  the   brain.  In  that   way,  the   brain   can “offload”  information   and  store it in an   external  memory that is more reliable   and  less energy consuming than its own working memory. In this case, we may say that the mind extends INTo the physical environment (Clark & Chalmers, 1998), or that cognition is  distributed  across the brain and   various   material   supports   (Hollan,   Hutchins  &  Kirsh,   2000;   Hutchins,   1995).   A   simple example is taking notes. The markings on the paper change as the results of our actions (writing). On the  other   hand,  they  remain safely  stored   while  we  do  not  INTeract with the   paper.  When perceived (read),  they trigger  thoughts and corresponding new actions, such as adding a related item to the list of already registered items. A  useful  paradigm to conceptualize  the  dynamics of such environmentally  mediated activity is the concept  of  stigmergy  (Parunak,  2006;  Susi  &  Ziemke, 2001; Heylighen,   1999,  2007).  An activity is stigmergic if the action by an agent leaves a mark (stigma in Greek) in the environment that stimulates an agent (the same or another one) to perform further work (ergon in Greek). This subsequent action will leave another mark which in turn will stimulate yet another action. Thus, different actions indirectly trigger each other,  via the traces they leave in the  environment. For example, upon noticing that someone has used up all the paper, you leave a note to your secretary  to  buy  paper;   the  subsequent  appearance  of  paper   reminds  you  to   prINT that  long  report;  the prINTout   in   turn   stimulates  you  to   study   its   recommendations;  etc.  Stigmergy  was   initially conceived  by Grassé (1959)  to  explain the activity of social insects,  such as termites  and  ants. This collaborative   activity, such  as   nest  building,  is  apparently complex,  INTelligent   and  goal-directed. Yet, the individual insects are INTrinsically very dumb, lacking anything like a working memory   or   ability   to   plan.   Thanks   to   the   mechanism   of   stigmergy   their   work   is   efficiently coordinated.10
The  environment  not  only  provides  a  passive   medium   that  registers  the  effect  of  actions:   it actively  INTervenes  in  the  agent’s  activity, producing   opportunities to   perform new  actions  or disturbances that make the actions’ result deviate from what was INTended. In situated cognition, opportunities   for  action   created   by  the   presence   of  specific   objects   or  situations   are  called affordances (Norman, 1999). For example, the presence of a phone affords you the opportunity to make a call.  Because our brain has evolved to quickly adapt to its  environmental situation, our perception  is especially  tuned to the  recognition of  both disturbances,  that create problems that need to be addressed, and affordances, that may help us to solve problems and achieve our goals (Gibson, 1986).Being in controlAnother   simple   paradigm  to  understand   this  agent-environment   INTeraction  is   the  cybernetic notion of  feedback control  (Powers, 1973;  Heylighen & Joslyn, 2001), which is also  known as error-controlled regulation. A goal-directed agent, such as an ant or a human, tries to achieve its goals  by  eliminating   any difference   between its  present  situation  (perception)   and  its   desired situation (goal). A goal here should not be understood as a completely specified objective or end-state, but   merely  as an   (explicit or  implicit) preference   for  certain situations   over  others.  For every perceived difference between the present situation and the goal, an action is performed to reduce that deviation, i.e. bring the situation closer to the preferred one. If the result as perceived is not sufficient, a next action is performed to again bring the situation closer to the goal, and so on,  until  the   agent   is   satisfied.  Although   some   actions may be counterproductive (in that they increase the distance to the goal), the overall process tends to zoom in efficiently on the goal because of negative feedback: every new action tends to correct the errors created or left over by  the previous action. External disturbances are dealt with in the same way: whatever  caused the deviation or error, the system’s reaction is to try to maximally reduce it, until there is no deviation left. In that way, the system remains in control of the situation, by efficiently counteracting any movement  away  from  its   desired course  of  action.  In   feedback  control,  there  is no   need  for  planning or for complex reasoning. This makes the mechanism very robust, and able to deal with the most complex circumstances (Gershenson & Heylighen, 2004).This   cybernetic   notion   of   control   is   at   the   basis   of   the   psychological   state   of  flow (Csikszentmihalyi & Nakamura, 2002). Flow is the pleasurable state that people experience when they are absorbed in an activity that demands their full attention, but such that they feel in control, i.e. able to effectively move towards their goal,  however   far   away   this   goal   still  may   be.   The psychologist  Csikszentmihalyi  (1990) discovered the  flow state by  finding common patterns  in those activities during which people reported the highest level of pleasant feelings, as measured by the method  of experience sampling.  Flow is characterized by  a clear sense  of goals,  and by continuous feedback indicating in how far the last action brought the situation closer to the goal. To experience flow, challenges should match skills,  i.e. the task should be neither too difficult, which  would produce stress and  anxiety, nor too  easy, which would  produce boredom. During  flow, people tend to forget their worries and even their notion of time, focusing completely on the task  at hand. Typical  flow  producing activities (for  those who are  good at them)  are playing a video game, performing music, paINTing, playing tennis, or climbing rocks. But flow can also be achieved   during   everyday   work—even   during   something   as   prosaic   as  assembly   work   on   a factory conveyor belt—provided the above conditions are met (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). 11
Situated cognition: conclusionWe may conclude that the feelings of stress, anxiety, and information overload (Shenk, 1997) that are  often  experienced during knowledge  work may be avoided  by  restoring a sense  of  control. Given the limitations of the brain, this is best achieved when the INTrinsically difficult functions of information processing, memory, and the triggering of actions are as much as possible delegated to the environment (cf.   Kirsh,   1996,  2000).   This  means   that  we  should   choose  or   arrange  the external situation in such a way that it can reliably store information, stimulate new actions, and provide feedback about the effectiveness of previous actions. In that way, it will allow a complex train of activity to be efficiently sustained, coordinated, and steered towards its INTended goals. The different components of this mind-environment INTeraction are summarized in Fig. 2. We can distinguish two nested levels of mind: 1) the traditional idea of mind as inherent in the brain; 2) the “extended mind” (Clark & Chalmers, 1998) which encompasses the brain together with any external memories that are used to support information processing. In the traditional perspective, external   memory   is   part   of   the   environment.   In   the   cybernetic   or   distributed   cognition perspective, however, it is part of the agent, since it is completely controlled by the  agent. The part of the environment that is not under control—i.e. which does not perform merely as the agent expects—INTervenes in the agent’s activity via what we have called affordances and disturbances. These,  together with the  feedback received via the environment  about previous actions  and the reminders stored in the external memory, determine the situation as perceived by the agent, and therefore the agent’s further actions. Fig. 2: the major components of mind-environment INTeraction.The environmental  situation  with its affordances and  disturbances  is perceived by the mind/brain.  The  information in  this perception is processed and compared with the goal or preferred situation. This determines an action to correct any deviation   between   perception  and  goal.  The   action  affects   the  situation,   and  some  aspects  of   this  new  situation, influenced by further disturbances and affordances, are again perceived (feedback via the environment). Some actions merely function to register information for later review  in an external  memory, which is not affected by disturbances. The external  memory together  with  the mind/brain  constitutes  the “extended  mind”,  i.e. everything  that  is under the direct control of the agent.12
4. Cognitive paradigms applied to GTDGiven the situated and embodied perspective on cognition and action, we are ready to provide a scientific motivation for the different recommendations of GTD. We can first note that Fig. 2 can be  seen  as   a  simplified  version  of   the   GTD  flowchart  in   Fig.  1,  with   the   different  external memories collapsed INTo a single one. The affordances and disturbances of Fig. 2 are simply the “stuff” collected in the In-basket of Fig. 1. The feedback in Fig. 2 makes explicit the fact that the monitoring of performed actions generally suggest further actions to be added to the In-basket. Let us now summarize the most important innovations proposed by GTD and INTerpret them from within this cybernetic/cognitive framework.Externalizing memoryThe first basic message of GTD is that you should as much as possible get everything out of your mind and INTo a trusted external memory, e.g. by writing it down on paper or in a computer file. In that way, not only won’t you forget important or simply INTeresting tasks, plans, references or ideas, but you will feel much less stressed by the need to remember all that “stuff”. Indeed, the limitations of both working and long-term memory are such that you cannot rely on them to recall all the important facts when they are needed. Trying to do that will merely overburden the brain, as it requires several patterns of neural excitation to be kept activated without getting distracted or undergoing  INTerference  with  new information   coming  in.  The  brain  is   an INTrinsically   active medium  where   patterns   are  always in flux. As such, it  is   poor at keeping track of unchanging details. The passive  media   of   paper  or   hard  disk   are  much  better   at  storing   information  in an invariant way, so that you can be sure that what comes out is exactly what you put in.Stigmergic actionThe next basic message of GTD is that you should register information as much as possible in an “actionable”   form,   i.e.   in  a  way  that  stimulates  you  to   act  when  you   review   your   external memory.   This  fits   in   with  the   perception→action  logic  that   underlies  situated   cognition   or cybernetic control. Reviewing your external memory means re-entering it INTo your brain so that its  underlying  patterns   can   be   recognized   by   your   long-term   memory.   If   the   meaning   of   those patterns is not clear, the brain will need to further process them, by combining them with various other  related patterns, in the  hope that some new pattern will  emerge in which  everything  fits. This pattern may then suggest a specific action. While such INTerpretation processes are necessary in complex or novel situations, they demand a lot of additional effort, without any guarantee of success. Therefore, to work efficiently, such processes should as much as possible be avoided, or at least be performed independently of the actions that eventually need to be executed. GTD   recommends   performing   this  reflection  before  the   pattern   is  registered  in   the   external memory.   In  that  case,   reviewing  the  external  memory   will  avoid  remaining   vagueness   and ambiguity, and the procrastination that this typically engenders. Instead, the reviewed item should directly suggest  the action to be taken, maINTaining the flow of activity without INTerruption for further reflection. The  whole activity can  then be performed in  a quasi-automatic, “stigmergic” mode,  where   the   note   read   immediately   triggers   an   appropriate   action.  Moreover,   GTD makes items more actionable by classifying them in a number of discrete categories, each demanding a specific   type   of   action   (Next   action →  perform,  Project →  plan,  Someday/maybe → reconsider...), so that there is no doubt in your mind about what the next step is. 13
Situated actionAnother basic   principle of   the GTD   method is  that the   decision to   perform  an action   should depend first of   all   on  the  situation, i.e. the   local   circumstances  that  determine  in  how   far  the action is easy to perform here and now. This is considered more important than ordering to-dos by priority, project, or planning. For example, it is recommended that you arrange all phone calls you have to make together in an “at phone” context, and all things you have to discuss with your boss  in  a “meeting with  boss”  context. When deciding which   of several possible  actions  to do first, you moreover take INTo account more subjective situational factors, such as “how much time do I have?”, and “how much energy do I have?”. Only after all these factors have been considered should you think about priorities when deciding about what action to do now. The  principle is that an  action  is performed most  efficiently  in the presence of  the mental and physical resources, triggers, and affordances that facilitate performing it. For example, sitting in a quiet room next to your phone with its preprogrammed numbers makes calling easy. In principle, you could perform  the same calls standing next to a public phone on a noisy street corner, but obviously this will seriously reduce your productivity while increasing your stress level. On the other hand, the  street corner may  constitute the  appropriate situation for buying flowers,  as the presence of a flower shop not only affords you the opportunity of purchase (which also exists via the phone or INTernet), but also stimulates your senses of sight, touch and smell, so that you can INTuitively pick the best option. A similar facilitation occurs on the mental level.  For example, it is easier to reflect  about how  to tackle a  particular project after  you just had  a conversation  or read a report about that project, because the relevant aspects are still fresh in your mind. Popular culture knows about this principle through the proverb “you should strike while the iron is hot”. On the other hand, switching (mental or physical) context costs time and energy, so it is better to minimize  it.   For   example,  after you just read a report  about   project A, somebody calls you to discuss  project B. After  the phone  call, to continue  with A you  will have  to  put B  out of your mind and  try   to  remember the  relevant   issues  in A.  This   refocusing  effort  is  a   pure  waste  of mental resources:  if  you  had  finished your  work   regarding  A  before  addressing  B, the whole operation would have consumed less time and attention, and most likely have had better results. This   is  why   disruptions  are   to  be   avoided.   Frequent   INTerruptions,  e.g.   by   incoming  email messages or phone  calls,  significantly   reduce   a   worker’s   productivity,  presumably   because   the mind finds it difficult to reacquire its focus after having to shift its attention (Czerwinski, Horvitz & Wilhite, 2004). The principle of staying within the same context also appears in the “two minute rule” of GTD: if it takes less than two minutes to perform an action, do it immediately rather than file it for later  processing. Indeed, considering an item in order to decide which type of action it requires already sets up a  mental context around that item. A short action will be performed most easily within that context. If instead the item is classified for later processing, this mental set  will have to be recreated. This may take more time than the two minutes it takes to perform the action now and thus eliminate the item from the to-do list.Adapting more important than planningUnlike  other  “project management” or “time  management” methods, GTD does  not  emphasize explicitly   defined  priorities,   milestones,   or  deadlines,   i.e.  formalized   planning   schemes   and objectives. These may be necessary for large-scale but well-defined projects, such as building a factory   or   organizing   a   customer   survey.   However,  they  tend  to  be   counterproductive   for everyday   tasks   and   duties,   such   as   answering   your   mail,   arranging   a   meeting,   or   simply organizing your thoughts.   One   reason  is  that  setting   up  a  plan   demands  quite  a  lot  of   mental 14
effort, involving the kind of abstract symbol manipulations for which our brain is not very well suited. For simple, routine activities, starting the job with just a few reminders of what should be done will get you to the desired result more quickly. Moreover, in our quickly evolving information society we are bombarded with new constraINTs, challenges   and   opportunities  (what   we   have   called  affordances   and   disturbances),   so  that priorities and plans constantly need to adapt. What seemed to be a good idea two months ago may well appear outdated today. As a result, you cannot look ahead in any detail for more than a few months. Applying GTD means being ready for any opportunity that arises, but without forgetting earlier commitments. To achieve that, you simply need to register all the INTeresting opportunities and decide whether you commit to them now or merely file them as Someday/maybe. When the situation changes or new information comes in, some of the  Next actions  you had committed to may no  longer appear so important, whereas a  Someday/maybe  may now  turn out to be worth committing to.  In any case,  the INTeresting opportunities will still   be  available in your  external memory,  ready to produce  actions—unlike  a more rigid   plan where everything  will have to  be rescheduled once it turns out that some objectives are no longer worth achieving.This flexible and pragmatic approach fits in with the cybernetic paradigm, which notes that error-controlled regulation or feedback (reacting after the  event)   is   more   basic   and   dependable  than anticipatory regulation or feedforward (acting on the basis of plans or predictions) (Heylighen & Joslyn, 2001; Gershenson & Heylighen, 2004). The reason is that predictions can never be fully reliable:   there  are   always   unforeseen  events   that  disturb   the  most   carefully   laid  out   plans. Feedback control, on the other hand, is specifically INTended to cope with disturbances. Whatever the nature of the disturbance, once it has been assessed, a counteraction is produced to reduce its effect. If this corrective reaction occurs quickly enough, the disturbance will be dealt with at the early stage when it is still easy to handle, and not have the time to grow INTo a serious problem. Planning,   of  course,   is  still   useful—and   necessary  in   those  cases   where   problems  may   be foreseen,  such  as   catastrophes,  that are  too  large to  be  counteracted  after  the   event.  But  the planning mode advocated by Allen (2001, p. 54) is loose and flexible, emphasizing a clear sense of overall purpose coupled with a spontaneous “brainstorming” approach where different ideas on how to approach the goals are written down in an external memory, and then organized according to their INTuitive relationships, rather than an imposed, formal structure. This “natural” planning method fits in  much better with  the way our brain  works, and is more likely to adapt  easily to unforeseen circumstances. Indeed, the situated action approach (Suchman, 1990) reminds us that plans must always remain subordinated to the situation: whenever something unexpected happens, control switches back to the feedback   mode, and   any plans   will have   to  be adapted   or improvised   from scratch.  This applies in particular to basic research, which is in a sense the epitome of knowledge work. There is   an  unfortunate   tendency  in   science   funding   to  demand  detailed   and  explicit   planning   of research  projects.  Research, by definition, is   INTended to be  creative   or innovative. This means that   its  results  cannot  be  predicted:   if  you  could   anticipate  a  discovery,   it  would  not  be  a discovery. Moreover, as an almost purely information-based enterprise in a very rapidly changing environment, its objectives constantly have to adapt to new insights and observations. Requiring the achievement of a priori fixed objectives, deadlines, milestones and deliverables is absolutely counterproductive   to  innovation,   as  it  forces  practitioners  to  restrict  their  goals   to   safe   and predictable outcomes, while ignoring unexpected opportunities.Organizing from the bottom-upAgain in contrast to more traditional management methods, GTD starts from the bottom (concrete 15
issues you have to deal with) rather than from the top (high-level goals and values). The rationale is that modern work and life are so complex that if you start from abstract, idealistic goals and try to work your way down to their concrete implementation, you will simply be overwhelmed by the number of possibilities you have to take INTo account. This is likely to result in a scheme that is either unworkably ambitious, or rigidly limited. GTD proposes that you first tackle the concrete  issues that presently   demand  your   attention,  until you feel   more   or  less  in   control.  Only  then  should you start considering long-term implications of what you are doing, at increasingly more abstract levels. If this long-term extrapolation appears unsatisfactory, it may be time to redefine your  higher  priorities  and  change   course,   safe  in  the  knowledge   that   at   least  the  short-term problems are under control.This recommendation can again be motivated from  cognitive   and   cybernetic   principles. Long-term   planning   requires   the   kind   of   abstract   symbol   manipulation   that   is   INTrinsically   very demanding on the brain. Moreover, given the lack of sensory feedback, the plans that are laid out in this way are likely to remain vague, abstract and unrealistic. Making them more concrete will run INTo all the contingencies and unforeseen perturbations that make detailed plans INTrinsically undependable.  On   the   other hand, any unsolved present issues  will   remain   nagging,   creating a sense of anxiety and lack of control,  that makes it difficult for the mind to  focus on something faraway.   When   daily   activities   are  running  smoothly   and   on   course,  it  becomes  easier  to extrapolate this course towards an increasingly distant future, thus getting a sense of where long-term priorities are best laid.Using feedback to keep on trackWithout planning, the danger is that you would just wander from one thing to the next, without  clear goal or  direction. To counter  that, GTD  teaches you  to couple a sense of  overall purpose with a   concrete list   of  Next  actions,  i.e.  the  very  next  steps  you  need to   take to   move  your project(s) forward. Each time you have performed  one of  these tasks, you can mark it off, thus getting the concrete feedback signal and satisfaction that you are moving forward, and be ready to perform or define a subsequent “next action”. In that way, you are constantly advancing towards your  goal  at   the   most  efficient   speed,   without   the  need   for   a   deadline   or  otherwise   artificially imposed time schedule to make sure that you attain your objectives.Such feedback-driven, unINTerrupted advance towards your goals, at the highest pace you still feel comfortable with, is precisely what Csikszentmihalyi (1990) found to produce the experience of flow.  Allen  (2001,  p.  10)   refers   to  the  corresponding  mental  state   as  the  “mind   like  water” experienced in martial arts. The idea is that if your GTD task management system is set up well, doing your work becomes stress-free, seemingly effortless, and a source of continual satisfaction. While   we   personally   have   not   yet   reached   that   Zen-like   state   while   dealing   with   various administrative   hassles,  Csikszentmihalyi’s  (1990)   work  makes  it  very   plausible  that  applying GTD, with its emphasis on clearly  defined goals, feedbacks and efforts adapted to the concrete challenges of the situation, would indeed bring one closer to a flow state.5. Extending GTD to support collaborative workGTD   is  INTended   as   a  method  to   enhance  the  productivity   of   individual   knowledge  work. However, as Allen (2001, p. 255-256) poINTs out, its application in an organizational framework will moreover produce collective benefits. Most obviously, if every individual in the organization becomes more efficient, the group as a whole profits. More specifically, GTD is INTended to make individual work more  dependable, by reducing  the risk  that commitments  are neglected. If  you 16
are less likely to forget or postpone the promises you made to your co-workers, your co-workers will have more trust in your contributions. If all people in an organization become similarly more reliable in performing the tasks they have committed to, the organization as a whole will function much more efficiently, profiting from increased trust, synergy and social capital, while being less vulnerable to friction, conflict and confusion.However, in addition to these spontaneous organizational “side-effects” of GTD, we can envisage   more   direct   contributions  to  organizational  efficiency,   by   extending   the   underlying cognitive and cybernetic principles to collaborative work. To do that, we can build further upon the   paradigm   of   stigmergy,   which   was   initially   proposed   to   describe   the   collaborative organization of social insects. The advantage of externalizing information INTo the environment is not only   that  it supports   individual  information processing,  but   also that  it  facilitates  sharing between different  individuals.   Indeed,  an external  memory,   such  as a  library   or  database, can typically be used by many people—unlike the memories in your brain. But the stigmergic/GTD paradigm focuses on more than mere information storage: it demands the externalization of tasks, to-dos or   “next  actions”, i.e.   the  registration  of   concrete stimuli  that  trigger an   activity when encountered in the right context. By sharing these, coordination between different agents becomes much easier.Let us  illustrate this with a classic example of insect stigmergy (Bonabeau et al., 1999; Heylighen, 1999): the creation of a network of pheromone trails by ants. When an ant finds food, it will leave a trail of pheromones (smell molecules) on its way back to the nest. An ant setting out from the nest looking for food will preferentially walk along such a pheromone-marked path. If it too finds food, it will come back along the same route leaving more pheromone. The larger the food source, the more ants will thus come back from it while adding pheromone, and thus the stronger the trace will become. The stronger  the trail, the more ants will follow it  to find food. Once   the  food   is  exhausted,   no  more   pheromone  will   be  added   and  the   trail  will   quickly evaporate. In this way, ants are efficiently steered towards the presently most promising locations for carrying   out  their main   task: bringing   food  to  the nest.   They  need  neither to  individually remember locations, nor to communicate them to other ants: the pheromone network performs the function of both a shared external memory and an indirect communication medium that triggers  productive action. Let us try to imagine how such a mechanism could be implemented in a collective GTD-like system. Most obviously, we can provide shared access to most components of the GTD filing system. Modern computer   and   network  technology makes it   easy  to  create a shared  reference system,  where  all   bits   of   information   that   are   potentially  useful   for   one   of   the   members   of   an organization are stored  for all to be consulted. For example,  if you get  an announcement  of an INTeresting   new  publication   or  the   address  of   a  potential   customer,   you   can  store   it  in   the organization database, where others can find  it by entering relevant  keywords. Another already existing   tool   is   a   shared   calendar,   where   members   of   a   working   group   can   mark   meetings, presentations, or other events that are  relevant to more than  one individual. Similarly, we have recently seen the appearance of group tools for brainstorming, mindmapping or outlining, which can be used to support the “project planning” stage of GTD. More  complex  workflow  systems  can  support   the  process   of   delegating  tasks  to  co-workers. However, these  tools typically assume  a rigid scheme that  specifies exactly who  does what  when. Such  explicit  plans run  counter to the philosophy of adaptability, opportunism and self-organization  that characterizes GTD and stigmergy. A more flexible approach is suggested by job ticketing systems, which are used in organizations such as call centers that provide support about technical   problems  concerning  software or   hardware. When   a customer   calls in   with  a specific  question,  an  expert needs  to   be  located  that   has  the  relevant  knowledge   and  that  is available as soon as possible. Rather than immediately delegating the task to a specific individual, the system creates a “job ticket” with a short description of the type of problem. These tickets are added to a shared pool of tasks to be performed. When one of the technicians has finished a task, he or she will immediately consult  the pool and select  the task that  best falls within his  or her 17
domain of expertise as a “next action”. In that way, tasks are performed in the most efficient way without need for any advanced planning, and thus without a risk of unanticipated problems (such as a job requiring more time than expected so that the designated technician remains unavailable for a newly delegated task).What will be needed for a collaborative GTD system is an INTegration and coordination of these different systems so that an organization-wide task monitoring system is created. Incoming items  will first have  to be processed and  classified individually according  to  the existing GTD scheme, except that now an additional decision has to be made about whether to file the item in  the individual or in the organizational memory  system. Items for the organizational system will have to be classified as  Reference,  Someday/maybe, Calendar,  Next action  or  Project. Note that items that individually may fall in one category (e.g.  trash) may collectively fall in another (e.g.  Reference):   what   is   irrelevant   for   one   person   in   the   organization   may   be   relevant   for someone else. The most important items are the ones that are actionable. Here the additional  decision needs to be made who will perform the action. In a truly flexible, stigmergic system that decision is  ideally  made  by the individual who   commits   to the action, not by  a  boss who delegates the action   to   a   subordinate   without   knowing   precisely   whether   that   subordinate   is   available, competent  or willing to  perform  it. The philosophy of GTD is   that people commit  to  a certain action on the basis of personal criteria, such as context, time, energy and priority—not because it is imposed on them. Normally, the individuals themselves are the ones best able to judge whether they are ready to perform a task. However, such freedom entails the risks that certain important tasks   are  never  executed,  or   that  certain  individuals   do  not  perform   their  fair  share   of  the workload. To  avoid   this,  items could  be   entered INTo the   shared work pool   with  a  number  of poINTs attached to them, where the poINTs represent an estimate of the importance of the task for the organization. Employees who satisfactorily perform one of the tasks in the work pool receive the corresponding poINTs. At the end of the month, their wages or bonuses may be calculated in function of   the total   number of   poINTs they   have earned.   This  would ensure   that everyone   is motivated to tackle as many important tasks as possible. The  system  would moreover stimulate  an  efficient and flexible division   of  labor, since employees would tend to select those available tasks for which they have most skills and the most appropriate situation. Indeed, they would perform these tasks more efficiently than less qualified colleagues,  and   therefore  become  available  more   quickly to   collect a   subsequent task   and its associated poINTs. This ability to work on the task that one feels most competent in is part of the explanation   for   the   surprising   success   of   open-source   software   development,   where   the programmers themselves decide what they contribute to (Benkler, 2002; Heylighen, 2007).If it turns out that certain tasks still have not been performed after an extended period, in spite of the poINTs they offer, this may be a signal for the management that the task is either not that INTeresting and therefore should better be withdrawn, or—if it is deemed really important—that the task is more difficult than expected and therefore deserves more poINTs. In that way, the pool of tasks with their associated poINTs and the pool of available workers will mutually adapt. Thus, the task pool could  start   to   function like an INTernal job  market   whose   “invisible  hand” efficiently matches supply (of worker’s efforts) and demand (tasks in the pool that require effort). Like   the   ant  trail   network,   such  a  job   market  is   an  example   of  quantitative,  marker-based stigmergy (Parunak, 2006; Heylighen, 2007), i.e. the quantity of markers (poINTs, or pheromones) attached to a task determines the amount of effort that is invested in performing it.18
ConclusionThe bombardment with information that knowledge workers presently undergo produces a lot of stress  and  confusion  (Shenk,  1997).  Traditional  methods   for  task and  time  management  only provide  superficial  relief,  because   they  fail  to   address   the  central  problem:  new   information typically   requires   reconsideration  of  priorities,   objectives  and  resources.  When  priorities   are inconsistent, methods based on optimization or detailed planning become ineffective. In his best-selling book of the same name (Allen, 2001), David Allen has proposed an alternative method: “Getting Things Done”, or GTD. In GTD, the focus has changed from establishing priorities to meticulously keeping track of opportunities and commitments for action. When (or even whether) these opportunities are followed up depends more on the affordances of the present situation than on any shifting plans for later. Referring to plenty of personal experience, its practitioners claim that this method minimizes stress, while ensuring that work proceeds smoothly towards maximal productivity. While there are as yet no empirical studies confirming these claims, we have argued that they can be justified on theoretical grounds. For this, we have reviewed a variety of concepts and insights  emerging from the new science  of situated and embodied  cognition, which has  largely overtaken the older symbolic paradigm within cognitive science. Proponents of situated cognition assert that  the  basic  functioning mode  of   the  human  mind  is not reasoning   and  planning,  but INTeracting  via  perception  and   action  with  the   environmental   situation.   The  kind  of   abstract, INTernal reasoning envisaged in the symbolic view of cognition is INTrinsically hard on the brain, because of its strict   “magical   number”  limitation  on  working   memory  and   the unreliability of recall  from long-term  memory. The more  natural approach to problem solving is simply trying out actions in the  environment and  using sensory-motor feedback  to correct the situation when errors  or  disturbances make it  deviate  from the goal.  Further  actions are typically triggered  by  such  feedback  together  with   the   affordances  and   disturbances of the environment, i.e.  by   new information coming in through the senses—not by pre-existing plans.  Moreover, the burden on memory can be very  much reduced by “offloading” information INTo a stable external memory, where it is safely stored and ready to trigger action later on. Although Allen  (2001,   p.  72)  merely  hINTs  at  the   perspective of distributed   cognition, GTD  appears   to implement  these same principles. It does this  by  insisting   that  all task-related information   be   stored  in  a   system   of   external  memories,  and   this   so   as  to  be   maximally actionable, i.e. ready to stimulate action. To achieve this, GTD proposes a detailed flowchart (Fig. 1)  that  formalizes   the  process   of   collecting   and   organizing  incoming   information   INTo a  set   of action   categories.  This  is   followed  by   reviewing  and   performing  the   registered   to-dos.  The emphasis  is  on  first doing   the actions  that  best  match   the affordances   and  constraINTs  of  the present situation, rather than the actions with the highest priority.  Implicitly, GTD assumes that all tasks in the external memory are worth performing; if in practice not all of them can be done,  then it is better to do as many as presently possible. To achieve this you should start with the ones that  require  the  least  time   and  effort  given  the  constraINTs  and   affordances   of  the  situation. Priorities  are  subjective  and  likely  to  change.  Affordances  are   objectively  given,  but  remain available only as long as the situation lasts. Therefore, maximizing productivity means optimally exploiting   the   present  affordances.   This   means   being   ready   with  a   comprehensive   list   of worthwhile actions to perform whenever the occasion presents itself.GTD’s claim of making   work   stress-free  can  be   justified on two grounds.   First,   GTD  minimizes the burden on memory and reasoning by systematically exploiting external memories. As argued   by   Allen,   this   will  reduce  the anxiety caused by not being sure that you remember everything you need to remember. Second, and more fundamentally, the consistent application of GTD  should promote all  the  features that characterize   the flow state:  a clear sense  of purpose; regular feedback as to-dos are “ticked off” one by one; on-going, unrestrained advance towards the   goals;   and  challenges  (tasks)   adapted   to   skills  (affordances  and   personal   abilities).   As extensively   documented   by  Csikszentmihalyi  (1990),   activities   with   these   features   are 19
characterized  by  a   sense of control, focus, and well-being—in sharp  contrast   to  the confusion, anxiety and procrastination that accompany the all-too-common situation of information overload (Shenk, 1997). Of course, we are never fully master of our own destiny, and from time to time challenges  will   be imposed   upon us   for which   we lack  the  necessary  skills. Therefore,  GTD cannot guarantee the absence of work-related stress, but it clearly seems like an important step in the right direction.The present reINTerpretation of GTD on the basis of recent scientific theories does more than  justify  GTD’s   experience-based   claims. By grounding the concrete recommendations in a broader theoretical framework, it enables a further generalization, improvement and extension of the methodology. We have discussed one example of such a suggested extension of GTD, from individual to collaborative work. This extension was inspired by the concept of stigmergy, which explains   how  shared   external  memories   can  support   the  coordination   of   collective   activity. Further research will be needed to explore this and other implications of our approach. In the meantime, we hope that both practitioners and theoreticians will be inspired by our paper to apply, test, and further develop GTD as a general method for knowledge work. Even if they do not use GTD proper, we hope that they will take to heart the general principles that we have reviewed,   such as   the  importance  of  external  memory   and situation,   and the  priority of adapting   over  planning.  The  philosophy  underlying  GTD   is   that  true  productivity   should   be measured  not by  the   number  of  planned objectives  that  are  achieved,  but   by  the  number  of INTrinsically   worthwhile results.   Whether   these   results   were   foreseen   or   not   is   completely irrelevant to their ultimate value. What counts is the total amount of progress made. As we have argued,  a   flexible  and   opportunistic approach   such as   GTD is   INTrinsically better   prepared to maximize productivity in this sense. ReferencesAerts, D. Apostel, L. De Moor, B.

Từ những thông tin trong cuốn tự truyện của Steve Jobs của tác giả Walter Isaacson, ta thử nhìn Jobs ở một góc nhìn khác: góc nhìn marketing, để hiểu lý do vì sao tờ báo danh tiếng về marketing là AdWeek và Đài phát thanh CBC đều đã xếp Steve Jobs đứng ở vị trí số 1 trong số những người làm marketing giỏi nhất thế giới. Thiên tài hay kẻ gàn dở? Steve Jobs là một người phá cách, biểu tượng của cảm hứng và sáng tạo. Ông bỏ học, thường bị mọi người gọi là kẻ nổi loạn, bất trị và quái tính, nhưng đó không phải là bí mật của Steve Jobs. Trên thế giới, không hiếm những thiên tài nổi loạn như vậy! Steve Jobs là một thiên tài công nghệ. Từ khi còn nhỏ tuổi, ông đã thích cùng bố nuôi sửa chữa các đồ điện. Ông còn tham gia vào CLB điện tử ở trường
trung học. Tài năng của Steve Jobs tỏa sáng đến mức Kỹ sư trưởng của hãng game Atari đã nhận Jobs vào làm nhân viên thiết kế trò chơi cho dù Steve Jobs chưa hề qua một khóa đ ào tạo chính thức nào về công nghệ thông tin. Nhưng đó cũng không phải là bí mật của Steve Jobs. Tại thung lũng Silicon Valley, người ta có thể kể ra vô số thiên tài công nghệ tuyệt vời. Steve Jobs là một thiên tài về thiết kế. Ông luôn bị ám ảnh bởi việc làm cho mọi thứ hoàn mỹ. Một sản phẩm với ông không chỉ tốt mà còn phải đẹp, không chỉ đẹp ở bên ngoài mà còn phải đẹp cả ở bên trong. Cuốn tự truyện của Walter Isaacson viết về Steve cho biết, khi kỹ sư ráp nối máy tính mẫu Apple II, Jobs đã yêu cầu kỹ sư phải thiết kế sao cho đường dây và vi mạch bên trong máy phải chạy thật thẳng, thật đều, thật đẹp, mặc dù có lẽ khách hàng chẳng bao giờ ngó vào những bộ phận này của máy tính. Một lần nữa, đó chưa phải là bí mật của Steve Jobs. Những nhà thiết kế công nghệ tài ba không phải quá hiếm. Steve Jobs có thể là một người phá cách, một thiên tài công nghệ và là một chuyên gia thiết kế ám ảnh bởi chủ nghĩa hoàn hảo, nhưng thế giới không thiếu những doanh nhân có đầy đủ cả ba tố chất trên. V ậy điều gì làm Steve Jobs trở nên độc đáo? Bí mật nào khiến Steve Jobs có thể biến Apple trở thành công ty có giá trị vốn hóa lớn nhất thế giới? Đó chính là khả năng tư duy của một nhà marketing chiến lược đi trước thời đại. Những quyết định marketing táo bạo của Jobs 1. Chọn tên thương hiệu
Trong những năm 70 vào 80 của thế kỷ XX, có hàng trăm thương hiệu máy tính xuất hiện trên thế giới. Những sản phẩm công nghệ thời đó chạy theo hai xu hướng. Một là những sản phẩm mang thương hiệu mở rộng - line extensions của công ty mẹ (như máy tính AT&T, Dictaphone, ITT, Memorex, Motorola, Siemens, Xerox); hoặc những sản phẩm có những cái tên kỳ lạ (như Commodore, Micro Pro). Thực ra, nếu so sánh về cấu trúc phần cứng, thời điểm đó, máy tính Apple không quá khác biệt so với những thương hiệu cùng lo ại. Tuy nhiên, điểm khác biệt lớn nhất ở đây chính là cái tên gọi: Apple. Một cái tên rất đơn giản. Steve Jobs đã đi xa hơn khi luôn cho thương hiệu Apple đi kèm cùng logo quả táo cắn dở. Từ góc độ thương hiệu, cái tên và logo có sự gắn kết chặt chẽ, thực sự đóng đinh vào trí nhớ của khách hàng, khiến khách hàng có khả năng liên tưởng mạnh mẽ. (Nhìn quả táo cắn dở, bạn có thể liên tưởng tới hình ảnh Micro Pro được không?). Đó là chưa kể việc Jobs đã thoát khỏi con đường mà khá nhiều doanh nhân cùng thời vấp phải, đó là đặt tên mình cho tên công ty. Nếu lấy tên những người sáng lập ra Apple để đặt tên thì sẽ ra sao? Liệu rằng Jobs & Wozniak Corporation có thể trở thành tập đoàn số một thế giới ?
2. Thương hiệu mới cho sản phẩm mới Năm 1979, trong lần viếng thăm Trung tâm Nghiên cứu Palo Alto của Xerox, Steve Jobs đã nhìn thấy một chiếc máy tính sử dụng giao diện đồ họa. Điểm khác biệt là máy tính này không dùng lệnh gõ mà sử dụng chuột để nhấn vào những thư mục ra lệnh. Công nghệ này trùng khít với ý tưởng của ông về việc làm sao đơn giản hóa máy tính đối với người sử dụng. Ông ngay lập tức bắt tay vào nghiên cứu công nghệ này. Ngày 24/1/1984, Steve Jobs đã cho ra mắt máy tính MacINTosh. Đây là một bước ngoặt trong tư duy thương hiệu của Steve Jobs. Trước đó, khi sản xuất máy tính, Jobs vẫn lấy tên ăn theo thương hiệu mẹ: Apple I, Apple II và Apple IIe. Đây là một cách đặt tên rất phổ biến trong làng công nghệ và Jobs đi theo lối mòn tư duy đó âu cũng là chuyện hết sức thông thường. Và, theo như dòng tư duy đó, có lẽ máy tính MacINTosh phải có tên Apple III.
Nhưng không! Jobs đã cho sản phẩm này một cái tên hoàn toàn m ới: MacINTosh. Một cái tên mới sẽ là một điểm kích tốt cho giới truyền thông. Tại sao sản phẩm này lại mang một cái tên hoàn toàn mới? Bởi vì nó khác biệt! Tại sao nó lại khác biệt? Bởi vì lý do a/b/c… Apple sẽ là công ty hưởng lợi nhất trong cuộc chiến truyền thông. Trong khi đó, đối thủ chính của Apple thời điểm đó là IBM cho ra mắt sản phẩm máy tính mới với cái tên theo lối mòn cũ: IBM PC. Đơn giản là máy tính của IBM. Với giới truyền thông, không có nhiều điều để khai thác với cái tên này. Hãy tận dụng quy luật marketing làm đòn bẩy cho sản phẩm của bạn: Nếu một sản phẩm mang những tính năng đột phá, mới mẻ, hãy cho nó một cái tên mới.
3. Sử dụng đòn bẩy của đối thủ Trong thế giới marketing, chiến lược thông minh nhất cho một công ty nhỏ hơn nằm chính ở đối thủ cạnh tranh. Hãy tìm ra đối thủ cạnh tranh là ai và xây dựng mình trở thành hình ảnh đối thủ. Trong tâm thức của người tiêu dùng, bạn sẽ nhanh chóng trở thành thương hiệu đối đầu với người mạnh nhất. Đó là điều Pepsi đã làm với Coca Cola. Đó là điều TH True Milk đã phần nào làm với Vinamilk. Đó là một chiến lược thông minh! Trở lại câu chuyện của Apple, thời điểm đó, đối thủ lớn và mạnh nhất của Apple là IBM với 50% thị phần máy tính. Steve Jobs đã chọn chiến lược sử dụng đ òn bẩy của đối thủ cạnh tranh. Ông đánh đòn quyết định ở một sự kiện lớn nhất tại Mỹ, đó là trận chung kết giải bóng bầu dục Mỹ - Super Bowl năm 1984.
Quảng cáo của máy tính MacINTosh trong sự kiện đó vẫn được coi là một trong những quảng cáo ấn tượng nhất của mọi thời đại, với hình ảnh của một vận động viên bé nhỏ thách thức một anh chàng to lớn. Điều đáng nói, quảng cáo khơi gợi một cách lý thú hình ảnh của anh chàng khổng lồ trên màn hình chậm chạp kia chính là IBM. Khán giả thích đứng về phía kẻ thách thức trẻ trung và nhỏ bé. Máy tính Mac đương nhiên ghi điểm. 4. Trở thành người tiên phong Chiến lược này rất phù hợp với cá tính đầy sáng tạo của Steve Jobs. Trong cuốn sách “22 quy luật marketing bất biến”, tác giả Al Ries và Jack Trout đã đề cập đến lợi thế đặc biệt của hai chữ “đầu tiên” và Quy luật tiên phong: Là sản phẩm tiên phong thì hơn là một sản phẩm tương tự có chất lượng tốt hơn. Bởi, cho dù sản phẩm tương tự có thể tốt hơn thì trong tâm trí, người tiêu
dùng đ ã bị ấn tượng mạnh nhất với sản phẩm tiên phong mất rồi. Một ví dụ đơn giản: Ai là người đầu tiên bay một m ình qua Đ ại Tây Dương? Rất nổi tiếng, đó là Chales Lindbergh! Ai là người thứ hai? Hầu như ít tài liệu nào ghi lại mặc dù người thứ hai là Bert Hinkler đã bay với thời gian nhanh hơn và ít tốn nhiên liệu hơn. Vị trí tiên phong nhiều nhất luôn mang lại một sức mạnh đáng kể đối với bất cứ thương hiệu nào. V ới Steve Jobs, ông đ ã liên tục là người tiên phong trong một dòng sản phẩm nào đó. Bộ phim Toy Story của hãng Walt Disney hợp tác cùng Pixar. Khi đó, Steve Jobs là chủ của Pixar và ông đã quyết định trở thành công ty đầu tiên làm đồ họa 3D cho một bộ phim hoạt hình dài 3D đầu tiên. Sự thành công của Toy Story đã đưa Pixar trở thành công ty tiên phong lĩnh vực đồ họa 3D điện ảnh. Hay như iPod - máy nghe nhạc với ổ cứng dung lượng lớn đầu tiên với bộ nhớ vượt trội hẳn so với những sản phẩm cùng dòng. 5. Những câu định vị và hình ảnh liên tưởng K hi trình làng những sản phẩm hoàn toàn mới trong một danh mục mới, khó
khăn của sản phẩm đó chính là việc khách hàng chưa quen thuộc và chưa có nhiều hiểu biết về cách sử dụng cũng như sự khác biệt của sản phẩm. Steve Jobs là một người theo chủ nghĩa tối giản, ông đơn giản hóa hết mức việc sử dụng những sản phẩm công nghệ cao. Đối với việc lựa chọn những thông điệp gửi đến khách hàng, ông cũng lựa chọn những câu định vị đơn giản nhưng có sức gợi mở lớn: Máy tính MacINTosh: “Think Different - Tư duy khác biệt”. Steve Jobs đã gửi một thông điệp về sự khác biệt của Mac đối với những loại máy tính khác. Máy nghe nhạc iPod: “1,000 songs in your pocket – 1.000 bài hát trong túi bạn”. Đó là thông điệp khác biệt về dung lượng bộ nhớ của iPod so với những máy nghe nhạc MP3 khác (lúc đó chỉ chứa được 30 bài hát). Ngoài ra, ông còn lựa chọn những hình ảnh đơn giản nhưng có sức liên tưởng mạnh đến câu định vị. Thuở ban đầu, Apple là thương hiệu. Ngày nay, Apple đã chuyển biến phần lớn thành tên công ty. Và công ty Apple Inc sở hữu hàng loạt thương hiệu mạnh bậc nhất trong từng dòng sản phẩm: MacINTosh, iPod, iPhone và iPad. Trong quá trình khai sinh ra hàng loạt thương hiệu hàng đầu trên thế giới, ngoài khả năng công nghệ phi thường, tầm nhìn hiếm có, Steve Jobs còn mang trong mình một bí mật lớn: Ông là một thiên tài marketing bẩm sinh. Đó là lý do tờ báo danh tiếng về marketing là AdWeek và Đài phát thanh CBC đều đã xếp Steve Jobs đứng ở vị trí số 1 trong số những người làm marketing giỏi nhất thế giới.','0'

The handbook is written for a broad range of readers as it devotes notable theoretical attention to trans-nationalism/post-colonialism, INTer-sectionality and globalization. There is an even balance between the theoretical considerations and practical implications within the field of gender and organiza-tions, and this is against a backdrop of largely Westernized literature. As such, this book is valuable in both theory and practice for the South Asian audience.ReferenceSturm, S. (2001). Second generation employment discrimination: A structural approach. Columbia Law Review, 101, 458–568.Erin Watson-LynnPhD Candidate, Monash Business SchoolMonash University, Victoria, AustraliaE-mail: erin.lynn@monash.eduSheryl Sandberg, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. Knopf, New York, 2013, 240 pp., ISBN: 978-0385349949.DOI: 10.1177/2322093715576166 Can a book written by one of Fortune’s 50 Most Powerful Women, addressing for the most part women in the US workforce be of any value to the debate on gender inequality in the South Asian workplace context? The answer to this question is a qualified yes.While most books on gender inequality focus on what needs to happen socially, culturally and institutionally, in her book, Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg frames the issue squarely in terms of what women need to do to address the barriers that exist within themselves that bar their rise to the top of the corporate chain. Rather than waiting passively for others to address issues related to inequality, this book exhorts women to “lean in”—to be ambitious, to take charge, to boldly go where not too many women have gone before. This is a refreshing change as rather than lament the ills of “glass ceiling”, “sticky floors” and “gender bias” that have hin-dered the progress of women in the workforce, the book acknowledges the work-place reality that favours men, and then moves the discussion forward by providing concrete ideas and suggestions that would allow women to achieve their true potential.The book is divided INTo 12 chapters (the graduate version of the book has six additional chapters offering advice and expert commentary on practical aspects of career such as writing a resume, preparing for an INTerview, finding the first job, negotiating salary highlights, as well as a guide for listening to one’s inner voice and leaning in for women of colour and millennial men). Each chapter highlights challenges women face in the workplace and then, using data and her own experi-ences, Sandberg makes a case for what women can do to overcome some of those challenges.

118  Book Reviewsher work life as well as those of other well-known women in power, the book also presents hard data and research evidence to back many of the key arguments.The first chapter titled “The Leadership Ambition Gap” has a provocative sub-title “What Would You Do if You Weren’t Afraid?” that underscores Sandberg’s key argument of the book that despite all the advances and opportunities that women have enjoyed in the recent decades, they hesitate to take the big steps, partly from fear of failure and fear of going against the norms but also because they have INTernalized the negative stereotypes. This poINT is reiterated in chapters “Sit at the Table” and “Don’t Leave Before You Leave”, where she excoriates women for hedging their bets where their careers are concerned and letting future roadblocks stymie their progress today. She acknowledges that when the road-blocks do become real, supportive spouse can make all the difference. In “Make Your Partner a Real Partner”, Sandberg advices women to think beyond the tradi-tional gender roles and to involve their spouses in house chores as well as parent-ing responsibilities. One might say it is easier said than done given how entrenched the gender roles are in most cultures, especially in South Asian countries. But it is still worth pondering as to whether one is engaging in “maternal gatekeeping” that may discourage men from feeling empowered at home. “The Myth of Doing It All” again implores women to shed the unrealistic goals of “doing it all” and per-fectionism and instead focus on obtainable goals of “doing what one can” and being happy.The chapter on “Success and Likability” provides sobering statistics on how career success comes at a cost for women. According to research cited in the book, successful women are disliked not only by men but also by women. The com-plexities of challenges women face in the workface do not have any quick fixes. But there is also reason to celebrate. Corporate careers no longer follow a single trajectory where one starts and ends one’s career with one organization and retires with a gold wrist-watch. Changing jobs and sometimes even professions several times over one’s career is the new norm and hence the chapter “It’s a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder”, INTroduces new metaphor jungle gym for career progression to replace the traditional corporate ladder analogy. According to Sandberg, this new reality is a good news for women as for most, careers are characterized by fits and starts with breaks as well as opportunities that materialize in non-traditional ways. The caveat is that women need to be ready to embrace uncertaINTy, take risks, focus on growth and opportunity rather than archaic titles and career levels. But she cautions against following the oft repeated advice on seeking mentoring of people at the top in the next chapter “Are You My Mentor?”. This appears some-what counter to her overall message of taking charge and boldly seek out oppor-tunities but her reasoning is that effective mentorship calls for a real and earned connection felt on both sides. The take-away is that rather than asking a stranger in a powerful position to serve as a mentor, it may serve a woman better to esta-blish a connection through a specific and well thought out approach. This calls for doing one’s homework, being cognizant of time commitment, and equally impor-tantly, being of value to the other party. Once again the idea is to shed the anti-quated notion of who a mentor is because in today’s day and age it could be a person of any gender or any level including somebody sitting in the cubicle next to you. by guest on February 16, 2016hrm.sagepub.comDownloaded from 
Book Reviews  119The chapters “Seek and Speak Your Truth” and “Let’s Start Talking About It” bring the discussion on gender inequality full circle. It is a tacit admission that despite all the expert advice and pep-talk that litters the book, no one person can bring about the sought-out change in her life alone. Rather than a self-help book for an individual woman, this work is more of a wake-up for women urging them to not accept the status quo in their own lives as well as those of others. Women need to speak up and try to bring about the change in beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviours that curtail equal opportunities for women. But again, unless those voices are heard and taken seriously, this issue will continue to be a quagmire. The example of how Harvard Business School, in two short years, was able to close the performance gap between males and females (as well as INTernational  students) shows the power of speaking up so that once heard how institutions can step up and make real and concrete change possible.Sandberg utilizes the age-old “what comes first, chicken or the egg” metaphor to frame the discussion on gender issues in the workplace. The chicken argument is about women pushing through the barriers that hinder their progress and then breaking them while the egg argument is about the need to eliminate the barriers so that women can succeed in the workplace. The debate about what needs to come first is very much relevant in the contemporary South Asian context. For decades, the gender inequality discussion has been dominated by the topics of social, legal, and institutional roadblocks on the road to gender equality. Countries in South Asia are at the cusp of instituting changes in response to recent events such as recent deaths of garment factory workers due to fires in Bangladesh, molestation of women in Delhi, India, among others. The idiom “strike when the iron is hot” is very much applicable here as the gender issue is square and centre in the public eye and taking leadership on this debate has a good chance to make a difference.There is a huge disconnect in the statistics for women participation in the labour force and women in leadership. While women represent almost half (47 per cent) of the US workforce, women representation is among the lowest in three of the largest South Asian countries. In Pakistan only one out of every five women while in Bangladesh and India one out of every three women are part of the work-force (Likhi, 2013). Compare these figures to the data on women leadership: 11 per cent of the leadership positions in India are held by women as compared to 4 per cent in the US. These statistics highlight the complexities and contradictions in the South Asian countries that call for more than a passionate call for women to lean in to eradicate the ills of gender inequality. The social, cultural and institu-tional barriers are real roadblocks and so the focus on the chicken as Sandberg calls it, is a refreshing change of dialogue, but there is also a fear that it may  burden South Asian women with unrealistic expectations of being the change they want to see.Lean In became an overnight hit when it was published in 2013 and continues to stir discussion as well as debate. Some discussion is inevitably on the author herself, some questioning her credentials for writing a book she jokingly calls a feminist manifesto, others holding her as a shining example of “having it all” as evidence by the overwhelmingly positive response she and her book received  by guest on February 16, 2016hrm.sagepub.comDownloaded from 
120  Book Reviews during her visit to India in July of 2014 (Prabhakar, 2014). The naysayers take umbrage to the underlying message of the book: women should stop being passive and stop blaming others for gender inequality and instead take charge of their own careers and shake the tyranny of low expectations. It minimizes the reality for women in many parts of the world, including South Asia where it is a delicate tightrope walk between pursuing one’s career and managing familial as well as societal expectations. Sandberg rightly acknowledges that vast majority of women are working to make ends meet and not necessarily pursuing fulfilling careers. Hence the message of the book may resonate most with those who are privileged either because they have resources, opportunities, and/or support but also those who have reached a leadership position, or those who are fortunate to be in an environment where they will not be unduly penalized if they speak up or take charge or try to make a difference. Yet, I believe this book serves as a beacon of what can be achieved if only women would believe in themselves and aim higher. This message is worth hearing and worth repeating so that it brings awareness and with awareness there is hope for a real dialogue that is needed to spur institutional change.ReferencesLikhi, A.

,'5','1','../assets/images/creativity.jpg','As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the worlds first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream first as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged an early partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later and against all odds, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever.
Since then, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner twenty-seven Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Now, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques, honed over years, that have made Pixar so widely admired - and so profitable.
Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip INTo the nerve center of Pixar Animation Studios - INTo the story meetings, the postmortems, and the BraINTrust sessions where art is born. It is, at heart, a book about how to build and sustain a creative culture - but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.','0'

A nightmare seized him from sleep, turned around his throat, and filled his mouth so full he could not cry out. Desperate for air, he opened his eyes onto a moonless night that denied him the face of his attacker.By all the saINTs! Who dares?He struck out, but a second attacker appeared and pitched him onto his belly. Though a foul cloth had been shoved in his mouth, the loosening of hands around his throat permitted him to wheeze breath through his nose. Then he was yanked up from the blanket on which he had made his bed distant from his lord’s tent.Too late realizing the error of allowing dishonor to incite him to isolation, he thrust backward and nearly found his release.Hands gripped him harder and dragged him toward the wood.
Who were these miscreants who spoke not a word? What did they INTend? Would they beat him for a traitor? Worse?A noose fell past his ears. Feeling death settle on his shoulders, he knew fear that surpassed any he had known. He shouted against the cloth, struggled to shrug out from beneath the rope, splayed and hooked his useless hands.
Lord, help me!
The cruel hands fell from him, but as he reached for the rope, it tightened and snapped his chin to his chest. An instant later, he was hoisted off his feet. He flailed and clawed at his trussed neck but was denied even the smallest breath of air. Realizing that this night he would die for what he had INTended to do...for what he had not done...for Henry, he would have sobbed like the boy he ever denied being had he the breath to do so. Unworthy! The familiar rebuke sounded through him, though it was many months since he had been called such. Aye, unworthy, for I cannot even die like a man. He turned his trembling hands INTo fists and stilled as the lessons taught him by Lord Wulfrith numbered through his mind, the greatest being that refuge was found in God. Feeling his life flicker like a flame taking its last sip of the wick, he embraced the calm that settled over him and set his darkening gaze on one of his attackers who stood to the right. Though he could not be certain, he thought the man’s back was turned to him. Then he heard the wheezing of one who also suffered a lack of breath. A mute cry of disbelief parted his lips. Of all those who might have done this, never would he have believed— Darkness stole his sight, swelled his heart, and brought to mind a beloved image.

By the bequest of an elder brother, I was left enough money to see me through a small college in Ohio, and to secure me four years in a medical school in the East. Why I chose medicine I hardly know. Possibly the career of a surgeon attracted the adventurous element in me. Perhaps, coming of a family of doctors, I merely followed the line of least resistance. It may be, indirectly but inevitably, that I might be on the yacht Ella on that terrible night of August 12, more than a year ago. I got through somehow. I played quarterback on the football team, and made some money coaching. In summer I did whatever came to hand, from chartering a sail-boat at a summer resort and taking passengers, at so much a head, to checking up cucumbers is Indiana for a Western pickle house. I was practically alone. Commencement left me with a diploma, a new dress-suit, an out-of-date medical library, a box of surgical instruments of the same date as the books, and an incipient case of typhoid fever. I was twenty-four, six feet tall, and forty inches around the chest. Also, I had lived clean, and worked and played hard. I got over the fever finally, pretty much all bone and appetite; but - alive. Thanks to the college, my hospital care had cost nothing. It was a good thing: I had just seven dollars in the world.The yacht Ella lay in the river not far from my hospital windows. She was not a yacht when I first saw her, nor at any time, technically, unless I use the word in the broad sense of a pleasure-boat. She was a two-master, and, when I saw her first, as dirty and disreputable as are most coasting-vessels. Her rejuvenation was the history of my convalescence. On the day she stood forth in her first coat of white paINT, I exchanged my dressing-gown for clothing that, however loosely it hung, was still clothing. Her new sails marked my promotion to beefsteak, her brass rails and awnings my first independent excursion up and down the corridor outside my door, and, incidentally, my return to a collar and tie. The river shipping appealed to me, to my imagination, clean washed by my illness and ready as a child’s for new impressions: liners gliding down to the bay and the open sea; shrewish, scolding tugs; dirty but picturesque tramps. My enthusiasm amused the nurses, whose ideas of adventure consisted of little jaunts of exploration INTo the abdominal cavity, and whose aseptic minds revolted at the sight of dirty sails.One day I poINTed out to one of them an old schooner, red and brown, with patched canvas spread, moving swiftly down the river before a stiff breeze.“Look at her!” I exclaimed. “There goes adventure, mystery, romance! I should like to be sailing on her.”“You would have to boil the drinking-water,” she replied dryly. “And the ship is probably swarming with rats.”“Rats,” I affirmed, “add to the local color. Ships are their native habitat. Only sinking ships don’t have them.”But her answer was to retort that rats carried bubonic plague, and to exit, carrying the sugar-bowl. I was ravenous, as are all convalescent typhoids, and one of the ways in which I eked out my still slender diet was by robbing the sugar-bowl at meals.
That day, I think it was, the deck furniture was put out on the Ella - numbers of white wicker chairs and tables, with bright cushions to match the awnings. I had a pair of ancient opera-glasses, as obsolete as my amputating knives, and, like them, a part of my heritage. By that time I felt a proprietary INTerest in the Ella, and through my glasses, carefully focused with a pair of scissors, watched the arrangement of the deck furnishings. A girl was directing the men. I judged, from the poise with which she carried herself, that she was attractive - and knew it. How beautiful she was, and how well she knew it, I was to find out before long. McWhirter to the contrary, she had nothing to do with my decision to sign as a sailor on the Ella.','0');

She was of a helpless, fleshy build, with a frank, open countenance and an innocent, diffident manner. Her eyes were large and patient, and in them dwelt such a shadow of distress as only those who have looked sympathetically INTo the countenances of the distraught and helpless poor know anything about. Any one could see where the daughter behind her got the timidity and shamefacedness which now caused her to stand back and look indifferently away. She was a product of the fancy, the feeling, the innate affection of the untutored but poetic mind of her mother combined with the gravity and poise which were characteristic of her father. Poverty was driving them. Together they presented so appealing a picture of honest necessity that even the clerk was affected.
"What is it you would like to do?" he said.
"Maybe you have some cleaning or scrubbing," she replied, timidly. "I could wash the floors."
The daughter, hearing the statement, turned uneasily, not because it irritated her to work, but because she hated people to guess at the poverty that made it necessary. The clerk, manlike, was affected by the evidence of beauty in distress. The innocent helplessness of the daughter made their lot seem hard indeed.
"Wait a moment," he said; and, stepping INTo a back office, he called the head housekeeper.
There was work to be done. The main staircase and parlor hall were unswept because of the absence of the regular scrub-woman.
"Is that her daughter with her?" asked the housekeeper, who could see them from where she was standing.
"Yes, I believe so."
"She might come this afternoon if she wants to. The girl helps her, I suppose?" "You go see the housekeeper," said the clerk, pleasantly, as he came back to the desk. "Right through there"—poINTing to a near-by door. "Shell arrange with you about it."
A succession of misfortunes, of which this little scene might have been called the tragic culmination, had taken place in the life and family of William Gerhardt, a glass-blower by trade. Having suffered the reverses so common in the lower walks of life, this man was forced to see his wife, his six children, and himself dependent for the necessaries of life upon whatever windfall of fortune the morning of each recurring day might bring. He himself was sick in bed. His oldest boy, Sebastian, or "Bass," as his associates transformed it, worked as an apprentice to a local freight-car builder, but received only four dollars a week. Genevieve, the oldest of the girls, was past eighteen, but had not as yet been trained to any special work. The other children, George, aged fourteen; Martha, twelve; William ten, and Veronica, eight, were too young to do anything, and only made the problem of existence the more complicated. Their one mainstay was the home, which, barring a six-hundred-dollar mortgage, the father owned. He had borrowed this money at a time when, having saved enough to buy the house, he desired to add three rooms and a porch, and so make it large enough for them to live in. A few years were still to run on the mortgage, but times had been so bad that he had been forced to use up not only the little he had saved to pay off the principal, but the annual INTerest also. Gerhardt was helpless, and the consciousness of his precarious situation—the doctors bill, the INTerest due upon the mortgage, together with the sums owed butcher and baker, who, through knowing him to be absolutely honest, had trusted him until they could trust no longer—all these perplexities weighed upon his mind and racked him so nervously as to delay his recovery.','0');

'SOMEBODY ought to know the truth about the Devil’s Island affair and I am going to tell it. The truth is generally either better or worse than the stories that get about. In this case it is somewhat better, though I am not proud of it.
It started with a discussion about married women having men friends. I said I thought it was a positive duty it kept them up to the mark with their clothes and gave a sort of snap to things, with out doing any harm. There were six of us on the terrace at the Country Club at the time and we all felt the same way that it was fun to have some body that everybody expected to put by one at dinners, and to sit out dances with and like the way one did one’s hair, and to say nice things.
“And to slip out on the links for a moonlight chat with you,” said Annette, who is rather given to those little pastimes, the most harmless in the world.
We were all awfully bored that Sunday after noon. Most of the men were golfing; and when you meet the same people all the time day after day, dinner after dinner, dance after dance any thing new is, welcome. Really the only variety we had was a new drink now and then. Some one would conic home from his vacation with a brand-new idea in beverages and order one all round, and it was a real sensation. Mrs. Gerhardt was no weakling. For a time she took in washing, what little she could get, devoting the INTermediate hours to dressing the children, cooking, seeing that they got off to school, mending their clothes, waiting on her husband, and occasionally weeping. Not infrequently she went personally to some new grocer, each time farther and farther away, and, starting an account with a little cash, would receive credit until other grocers warned the philanthropist of his folly. Corn was cheap. Sometimes she would make a kettle of lye hominy, and this would last, with scarcely anything else, for an entire week. Corn-meal also, when made INTo mush, was better than nothing, and this, with a little milk, made almost a feast. Potatoes fried was the nearest they ever came to luxurious food, and coffee was an infrequent treat. Coal was got by picking it up in buckets and baskets along the maze of tracks in the near-by railroad yard. Wood, by similar journeys to surrounding lumber-yards. Thus they lived from day to day, each hour hoping that the father would get well and that the glass-works would soon start up. But as the wINTer approached Gerhardt began to feel desperate.
"I must get out of this now pretty soon," was the sturdy Germans regular comment, and his anxiety found but weak expression in the modest quality of his voice.
To add to all this trouble little Veronica took the measles, and, for a few days, it was thought that she would die. The mother neglected everything else to hover over her and pray for the best. Doctor Ellwanger came every day, out of purely human sympathy, and gravely examined the child. The Lutheran minister, Pastor Wundt, called to offer the consolation of the Church. Both of these men brought an atmosphere of grim ecclesiasticism INTo the house. They were the black-garbed, sanctimonious emissaries of superior forces. Mrs. Gerhardt felt as if she were going to lose her child, and watched sorrowfully by the cot-side. After three days the worst was over, but there was no bread in the house. Sebastians wages had been spent for medicine. Only coal was free for the picking, and several times the children had been scared from the railroad yards. Mrs. Gerhardt thought of all the places to which she might apply, and despairingly hit upon the hotel. Now, by a miracle, she had her chance.
"How much do you charge?" the housekeeper asked her.
Mrs. Gerhardt had not thought this would be left to her, but need emboldened her.
"Would a dollar a day be too much?"
"No," said the housekeeper; "there is only about three days work to do every week. If you would come every afternoon you could do it."
"Very well," said the applicant. "Shall we start to-day?"
"Yes; if youll come with me now Ill show you where the cleaning things are."
The hotel, INTo which they were thus summarily INTroduced, was a rather remarkable specimen for the time and place. Columbus, being the State capital, and having a population of fifty thousand and a fair passenger traffic, was a good field for the hotel business, and the opportunity had been improved; so at least the Columbus people proudly thought. The structure, five stories in height, and of imposing proportions, stood at one corner of the central public square, where were the Capitol  ',

Trong kỷ nguyên số, vấn đề bảo mật và an toàn trên không gian mạng ngày càng trở nên quan trọng, không chỉ đối với các doanh nghiệp, tổ chức, chính phủ, mà còn đối với từng cá nhân. Việt Nam có 58 triệu tài khoản Facebook (tính đến hết quý 1/2018); 127 triệu thẻ ngân hàng với 66,6 triệu tài khoản thanh toán cá nhân; cùng hàng tỷ các giao dịch mua bán, trao đổi trên mạng diễn ra mỗi ngày. Chính vì vậy, an ninh mạng trong kỷ nguyên số đang trở thành một chủ đề ngày càng nóng.
Chỉ rất gần đây, nhiều tài khoản Facebook cũng như email cá nhân đã bị hacker tấn công và chiếm đoạt. Thủ đoạn của hacker khá đơn giản khi tận dụng các sơ hở của người dùng cũng như các lỗi bảo mật của hệ thống, nhưng chúng đã gây ra những thiệt hại rất lớn cả về vật chất và tinh thần cho người dùng – rất nhiều thông tin cá nhân bị lộ và bị mất, và điều đó cũng đang xảy ra với rất nhiều tổ chức, công ty, cả tư nhân lẫn nhà nước.
Ngay đầu tháng 11/2018, một số nguồn tin lan truyền trên mạng cho rằng hệ thống công nghệ của Thế giới Di động bị hacker tấn công và thông tin của khách hàng bị tiết lộ. Các tài khoản thẻ ngân hàng cũng như email và số điện thoại cá nhân bị kẻ xấu công khai trên mạng dù cho nghi vấn lộ dữ liệu khách hàng vẫn đang tiếp tục được điều tra, xác minh.
Ngược về quá khứ, tháng 4/2018, website của ngân hàng Vietcombank bị tấn công. Sự cố xảy ra với trang con của website Vietcombank khi người dùng đăng ký email liên kết với tài khoản ngân hàng. Khi được chia sẻ qua Facebook, ảnh bìa của trang con này hiển thị dòng chữ “Đại học Quốc gia Hà Nội”. Hacker còn để lại hai câu thơ “Trăm năm Kiều vẫn là Kiều/ Sinh viên thi lại là điều tất nhiên”.
Năm 2016, hệ thống các sân bay lớn tại Việt Nam như Sân bay Quốc tế Tân Sơn Nhất, Sân bay Quốc tế Nội Bài, Sân bay Quốc tế Đà Nẵng, Sân bay Phú Quốc đều bị hacker tấn công và để lại nhiều nội dung xúc phạm, xuyên tạc.
Cuối năm 2014, hệ thống các website của VCCorp cũng bị tấn công, làm tê liệt hoạt động truy cập vào toàn bộ hệ thống website báo chí đối tác của VCCorp và gây thiệt hại trực tiếp tới hoạt động của các trang này, đồng thời ảnh hưởng tới hàng triệu độc giả và người tiêu dùng sử dụng các dịch vụ trực tuyến của họ. Theo VCCorp, ước tính sơ bộ sau hai ngày bị tấn công, số tiền VCCorp bị thiệt hại vào khoảng 5 tỷ đồng, bao gồm tất cả các loại doanh thu như quảng cáo, thương mại điện tử…
Trên thực tế, không ít những vụ tấn công mạng đã xảy ra liên tiếp tại Việt Nam trong thời gian gần đây và để lại những hậu quả không hề nhỏ. Những vụ việc như thế này đang gióng lên một hồi chuông cảnh báo đối với các cá nhân cũng như doanh nghiệp trong thời đại số. Với xu thế phát triển mạnh mẽ của cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp 4.0 trên toàn thế giới, trong đó có Việt Nam, sự bùng nổ của các thiết bị IoT sẽ mang lại nhiều nguy cơ tiềm ẩn về các cuộc tấn công trên không gian mạng hoặc bị kẻ xấu lợi dụng để tấn công vào các hạ tầng.
Chuyên gia an toàn thông tin, vấn đề bảo mật không có tính tuyệt đối. Ngay cả các cường quốc trong ngành công nghệ thông tin-bảo mật như Anh, Pháp, Đức, Mỹ, Trung Quốc… cũng đều bị hacker tấn công. Vậy các doanh nghiệp và người dùng Việt Nam phải làm gì để vừa có thể tận dụng được những lợi thế của nền công nghiệp IoT mà vẫn đảm bảo an toàn thông tin trên mạng?
Nhằm mang tới cho độc giả và các doanh nghiệp, tổ chức những kiến thức cơ bản về bảo mật dữ liệu, cảnh báo người đọc về vấn đề quyền riêng tư và nâng cao ý thức bảo mật thông tin, Apha Books trân trọng giới thiệu bộ sách “An toàn thông tin trong kỷ nguyên số” gồm 4 cuốn: The Cuckoo’s Egg (Gián điệp mạng), Ghost in the Wires (Bóng ma trên mạng), The Art of Invisibility (Nghệ thuật ẩn mình) và Hackers lược sử. Thông qua các câu chuyện ly kỳ hấp dẫn về những cuộc truy bắt hacker, những chiến công của các hacker mũ trắng – những kẻ mê máy tính thông minh và lập dị, dám mạo hiểm, bẻ cong các quy tắc và đẩy thế giới vào một hướng đi hoàn toàn mới, độc giả sẽ có được cái nhìn toàn diện về hacker, về đạo đức nghề nghiệp cũng như tương lai của ngành công nghệ để có được cái nhìn rõ ràng hơn về an ninh mạng, chủ đề chưa bao giờ hết nóng hổi của các tín đồ mạng.
Bộ trưởng TT&TT Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng đã nhấn mạnh: “An toàn, an ninh mạng được coi là điều kiện để thúc đẩy chính phủ điện tử, chính phủ số và nền công nghiệp nội dung số. Vì vậy, Việt Nam phải trở thành cường quốc về an ninh mạng”. Đồng hành với những vấn đề thời sự nhức nhối hiện nay, với bộ sách này, Apha Books và các đối tác – những nhà cung cấp các giải pháp bảo mật & an ninh mạng như CMC, Netnam, Securitybox, CyRadar… mong muốn đóng góp một phần tri thức cho xã hội, giúp nền kinh tế số Việt Nam phát triển lành mạnh, bền vững.','0'

'“This wind is nuts!” I yelled as I struggled with the umbrella. Not that it was doing much good. The three of us were already sodden and miserable, so the flimsy plastic and metal wasn’t even good as moral support.
We were trying to get to our next class, but the storm had rolled in over Avonside University out of nowhere, and we were trapped, huddled behind some decorative art thing in a vain attempt to get out of the wind.
Bray looked miserable in his thin T-shirt, huddling up against the metal sculpture, while his friend, —whose name I still hadn’t gotten— looked slightly more comfortable in her similar getup.
“Here let me take it,” she called over the wind, her hands already reaching for the rebellious umbrella that was our only defense against the torrent of rain from above.
I hesitated for a moment, then nodded and carefully passed it to her. She looked like she could probably lift me over her head with a little effort. That wasn’t to say she was all muscle or anything, but there was enough definition in her arms to let me know I’d get my ass beat if it came to that. Which it wouldn’t because conflict was scary.
“You two boys ready to make a run for it?” she yelled over the wind, her tone teasing and amused.
“No!” Bray grumbled, but his nod said otherwise.
“And you? Lanky dude, whatever your name is?” she asked, raising an eyebrow at me.
Lanky dude? I mean fair, but ouch. I nodded, taking a few deep breaths to try and psych myself up for the sprINT. It looked like about forty meters to the door and INTo the atrium where we needed to go. Forty long meters swept by rain that was being driven almost horizontal by this storm.
“Go!” the girl called, and we ran.
Even considering my earlier appraisal of her, it was impressive to see her run and hold the umbrella over all three of us like it was nothing. Damn girl!
Our feet splashed through forming puddles as we bolted across the concrete tiles of the Patten Courtyard. My feet squished uncomfortably as rain filled my shoes up faster than a cup under an exploding faucet. Everything below my mid thigh was soaked, the umbrella could only keep the three of us covered up to a poINT.
Regardless, we made it INTo the Atrium, bursting through the doors in a spray of water and screeching wind. The door mechanism was failing to shut it automatically, so Bray’s friend tossed the umbrella back to me and leaned her shoulder INTo it until the latch clicked closed.
“Holy shit,” she laughed, her chest heaving with the effort. We were all soaked, her most of all. Her clothing clung to her frame in a very revealing way. I couldn’t keep my eyes off her abs, how the hell did those things even get like that? Smooth and toned at the same time.
“How did you even keep this thing upright, let alone covering us from the rain?” I asked, wrenching my eyes back to my umbrella.
I hadn’t been able to get it out before we’d all been drenched, that’s how fast the storm had rolled in, and now the thing was smashed and bent beyond hope. I’d need to get a new one.
“Yeah look at you! You’re like, buff! Are you one of those chicks that like deadlift or something?” Bray asked, openly staring at her.
“Uh yeah, I work out I guess. I lift and shit, but not like, a ton of the time or anything. I’m not INTerested in being a huge tanky chick or whatever. I mean don’t get me wrong, I think they’re hot as hell, but I don’t want to be one,” she shrugged, looking a little self conscious over the way her top was clinging. She wrapped her arms around her chest and stared back at Bray awkwardly.
“So you’re INTo buff girls then?” Bray teased, his eyes taking on a mischievous glINT.
“I guess, but I’m INTo girls. I like short, pretty, petite girls, I like tall willowy girls, and yeah… I like buff girls too,” she shrugged, I could see her becoming more uncomfortable by the second.
Bray had a problem with knowing when to stop, and it looked like now was one of those times.
“Bray, knock it off,” I said with as much casual good nature as I could manage. “After all, we wouldn’t want the topic of conversation to turn on you would we?”
There wasn’t actually anything wrong with the short blond guy’s tastes, Bray could like who he liked, but I knew the topic embarrassed him. I could use the playful teasing of that topic to save the girl from any more discomfort. Actually, had I gotten her name yet?
She might have told me actually, but I’d probably been spacing out, so to speak. It was a thing that happened to me sometimes, my brain just stopped processing speech as actual information, and suddenly I was listening to english like it was a foreign language.
Looking at her now, I was impressed with the balance in her body that she’d achieved between soft and hard. She was a generally pretty girl all around too, but then again, this was college. It seemed like every girl was pretty.
Anyway, other than her abs, there was another thing about her that I had taken passing note of. Her hair was short and pale blond, with these fascinating faded red and blue streaks through it. It wasn’t sun faded or anything though, it looked like she’d had it dyed by someone incredibly skilled, and with top notch product to boot.
While Bray struggled with his blush, I asked her, “Who did your hair? It looks incredible, despite how soaked it is now.”
“Oh,” she blinked, surprised by my change of conversational topic. “Uh, it was me. I’m training to be a hair stylist.”
“Nice, I really like it,” I said, then ran my hand through my very wet and very short military style haircut with a grin. “Think I should dye mine?”
“There isn’t much there to dye,” she chuckled, eyeing me over. “And plus, you don’t actually seem like the type of guy who dyes his hair.”
I laughed off her words, because for reasons that would baffle most people, they hurt like hell. I wished I had longer hair, but that was only part of it.
Then she squINTed at me, like she’d had a sudden realisation. “You aren’t hitting on me are you? I just said that I like girls, but I guess to be clear, I’m not INTo guys.” Her eyes flicked to Bray and she added, “Especially ones that stare.”
“He doesn’t hit on anyone, guys or girls,” Bray grumbled, clearly a little grumpy with both of us for the teasing and rebukes. “Never even seen him eye up a girl.”
“Doesn’t mean I’m not attracted to them,” I replied, a little sharply.
In reality, I wasn’t entirely sure who I was attracted to. I didn’t really like the concept of relationships, casual or otherwise. At least not while I was like… this. I didn’t want to be attracted to anyone right now, male or female.
To avoid meeting the eyes of the other two, I turned and looked out INTo the courtyard we’d just come from. Avonside University was gorgeous, despite the terrible weather that had rolled just now.
We were standing in what people called the Pyramid. It had a proper name and designation, but no one used those. The Pyramid was named like that because the roof was one big glass pyramid, the atrium itself being tacked onto one of the two large central tower blocks on campus. Covered and indoors, it was used as a student social and study space, with the nearby Oak cafe always available if you wanted overpriced food or coffee.
Outside the floor to ceiling glass was the courtyard we’d just come from, its neatly manicured shrubs and trees being whipped to within an inch of their lives by the storm outside. The rain was coming in so hard that it was almost hard to see through it.
“Sorry. That was rude,” I said, giving them both an apologetic expression. “I guess I’ve just never really been one for relationships. Can we change the subject? They seem like so much work after all. I can barely look after myself, how would I manage another person?”
“Sure,” the girl said, then smiled and walked over to slump INTo a nearby couch. “What’s your name?”
I couldn’t help a chuckle, following her lead and sitting down in a chair opposite. Yeah, we had totally skipped over the whole INTroduction part. We were classmates, had been for two years now off and on, but Avonside was huge, classes and year groups could get INTo the high hundreds. Bray, my best friend, was apparently friends with her, although I’d never spoken to her before we had all huddled behind that Sculpture.
“Elias,” I said finally, leaning over to offer her a hand, which she took, her grip far firmer than mine. I raised an eyebrow. “You?”
“Grace,” she replied, giving me an even amicable stare, like she was challenging me to remember it. I would. My memory was scary good.
“Nice name.”
She gave a shrug, looking slightly uncomfortable. “It’s a name, like everyone else’s.”
“Great, you know each other’s names now,” Bray said, rolling his eyes before turning them on me. “We still haven’t figured out how we’re getting back to the dorm though Eli. This storm is—”
Bray was INTerrupted when a flash lit the room, followed quickly by a thundering shockwave. My vision blurred, pain flashed through my body and the whole world took on a strange dizzing spin. Dazed, I tried to make sense of what had just happened. The chair I had been sitting on was on its back, I had been thrown clear. Glass was everywhere, the rain and wind had invaded the safety of the indoors.
“What the fuck,” Grace groaned from a meter away as she pushed herself up off the ground.
“Eli! Are you okay?” Bray called from somewhere, and I let out a grunt to let him know I was fine. I wasn’t sure I could talk at that exact moment.
“Was it a bomb?” Grace asked, her eyes staring out INTo the black of the storm. Then they narrowed for a moment before they flew wide in confusion and awe. “What the fuck is that?”
My eyes tracked out past the debris and INTo the black where she was staring, taking a moment to adjust and find whatever she was looking for. Of course, when I saw it, I wondered how the hell I had missed it.
Standing in the center of the courtyard, having apparently obliterated the fountain that used to be there, was a massive black monolith. It was so dark that I couldn’t tell if it was cylinder or rectangular, but it was definitely there, the top up INTo the black of the storm.
Other students who’d been in the Pyramid were taking notice now too, crowding forward as far as they dared to get a look. I could see people out there in the rain, picking themselves up off the ground where they must have been thrown like we were. Someone stepped out of the atrium and shone a high powered flashlight on the thing, a security guard maybe, and all of a sudden we could see it for what it was.
It was perfectly cylindrical, so smooth in fact that my eyes had trouble reading it, like the very light bouncing off it was wrong somehow. I could feel my vision growing tired and strained just trying to comprehend it. The rain was having trouble with it too, sluicing off it like the surface was hydrophobic.
Then another flash lit up the university, but this one was far gentler and far more strange. A pulse of light flashed out from the monolith, passing through everything and everyone like none of us where here. Two more came out in quick succession and I crawled forward to take cover behind the upturned couch. The other two joined me quickly, and we all shared a nervous glace or two. What was happening?
“This is like something straight out of a movie,” Bray said with a low audible gulp. “One of those sci-fi thrillers where the aliens come pouring out of that thing to eat us.”
“Shut up Bray,” Grace hissed, sending him a scolding look. “Don’t need your dumb, overactive imagination right now. We have crazy shit going on right in front of us.”
“Well it’s better than waiting for whatever horror that thing is about to set on us,” he almost snarled back.
Clearly my two companions were stressed, and I waved a placating hand. “Hey, both of you, come on. No need to get grumpy, we’re all nervous here. Except the big thing outside, I don’t think he’s nervous.”
Bray didn’t reply rolling his eyes instead, his mouth pressed INTo a thin line, but Grace gave me a quick sidelong glance and a weak smile. Phew. Bray never appreciated my jokes. But really, whatever was happening was bad enough without these two going at each other.
“Everyone please stay calm!” a shrill, anything but calm voice called out through the large room, and we all turned to see an elderly woman in a high visibility vest walking INTo the Pyramid. “The decision has been made to evacuate the building. Please move in a calm and orderly fashion towards your designated evacuation poINTs.”
Almost immediately I raised my hand with a cough. “Ma’am, that’s out there with the scary... uh, monolith thing. I’m not sure that’s a good idea.”
I almost called it a dildo, but managed to stop myself just before the word left my mouth. Now was not the time to be making dumb nervous jokes in front of the university staff.
“Ah… the alternative evacuation poINT then,” she said, sounding less than reassuring. I couldn’t blame her really, things had gone from normal to strange in a heartbeat.
We slowly did as the terrified woman asked, retreating from the smashed window and the monolith beyond. I couldn’t stop checking on Bray and Grace as we walked, my thoughts beginning to cycle worriedly between wondering what was happening and wanting to keep track of them. Familiar faces were important in times like this, I felt safer with them around.
We all flinched as another pulse of light shot out from the object behind us. Every time the pulse ran through me it felt like every energy drink I’d ever consumed was active in the same moment. It was a uniquely uncomfortable feeling.
I only made it a few more steps before a rapid series of pulses rushed through us and everyone staggered, eyes wild as they all sought out the source of their discomfort. The monolith was lightning up, crackling with energy, arcs of the stuff smashing INTo anything in the courtyard that could conduct electricity. My gaze met Grace’s, the confusion and fear I felt mirrored in her grey green eyes.
The weirdness wasn’t done with us yet though, not by a long shot. A sound rose about us, sounding like a steel cable being pushed past its limits. Then everything stretched. My whole body felt like it was being contorted at a base level, every cell screaming in fear and pain.
All I knew was the twisting and stretching, my mind wild and animalistic as it tried to make sense out of what was happening. At some poINT it stopped, but I felt strange, like my mind was spinning in my head, just constantly spinning. It wanted me to turn left, just turn left, just turn left. When I tried to satisfy it though, when I turned my head left, it just wanted more. More rotation, always rotate, always rotate. I screamed, or I thought I did. I wasn’t sure, I was trapped in—
Crack.
I came back jarringly, trying to figure out what was happening. I had clarity again, although my forehead stung, and I tentatively opened my eyes and looked around.
“What the fuck was that?” I heard Bray call, his voice shrill with pain.
I lay on the floor, as did everyone else. They were all caught in their own worlds, blinking and confused like I was. Things were getting wild, and I’d really like to stop being thrown onto the ground. It was like someone had taken my core being and shaken it like they were making a cocktail.
Distantly I heard the high visibility vest woman speaking urgently INTo her radio, and we all turned when she staggered to her feet and cleared her throat loudly. “Everyone is to move to 4A100 and wait, the staff will be getting a handle on the situation while everyone is safe there.”
“Isn’t that the main gym hall?” Grace asked.
I just shrugged, I’d never had any reason to go there, but Bray nodded. “It is, probably to keep us all safe in one place.”
“Well, lets follow the safety vest’s orders then,” I groaned, pushing myself wobbling up onto my feet.
Everyone slowly began to follow the staff member out the back and towards a hallway, and as I did the same, I noticed something strange. The rain had just stopped and with the storm gone, an unfamiliar night sky was visible through the glass roof of the Pyramid…',

'Inside the Cabinet Room, the President and most of his Cabinet were convened for an emergency meeting. The Cabinet included members of the National Security Council and the Chief of Staff. The cabinet meeting also includes the Secretary of the Treasury Stefan White, Attorney General Lara Wallace, Secretary of the INTerior Kirby Richmond, Secretary of Agriculture Irving Patton, Secretary of Commerce Michelle Sue, Secretary of Labor Solomon Mcclark, Secretary of Health and Human Services Brady Saunders, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Frances Moody, Secretary of Transportation Daniele Paul, Secretary of Education Leon Crawford, and Secretary of Veteran Affairs Alvin Johns. The President looked at everyone.
“As all of you have been informed, we have been transported INTo a new world. Because of this, we have many urgent issues we need to solve in order to survive in this new world. Irving, can we sustain our population using our own production?”
“Mr.President, I can guarantee you that the United States has a rate of more than 100% food self-sufficiency. However, we might be unable to produce some exotic crops.”
Hmmm… we might be able to find some exotic crops in this world.
“Good. Michelle and Solomon, some of our companies are going to be hit hard by this. Especially the ones that have foreign branches. In addition, some businesses might be hurt by a lack of workers. I need you two to sort this out.” 
Both spoke at the same time.
“Understood, Sir.”
“Cralson. I need the bases that are in…” 
The President paused
“I suppose we can’t call it Canada anymore.”
He pondered a bit. An alternative name...
“The Northern Frontier. I want the bases in the Northern Frontier to explore their surrounding area.”
“We are already doing that, Sir,” Cralson said confidently.
“Good. Now, the most important part of this meeting. Coby, can you tell us our oil consumption and production?” 
I’m afraid that I might need to make an announcement to the American people that there will be a restriction on oil use.
“We currently consume about 19 million barrels per day and we produce only about 9.3 million barrels per day. That’s a deficit of about 9.7 million barrels per day. We will need to greatly increase our production to keep up with the consumption. I recommend that as of right now we tap INTo our Strategic Petroleum Reserves. It’s also a good thing that we have about 36.5 billion barrels of proven oil reserves.”
“So we need to ramp up the production from our oil companies?”
“That’s true, Sir.”
Good. Well onto the next important resource
“In addition to our oil issue, we probably need to ramp up mining of metals since we can’t import them anymore.” 
Probably easier said than done. The environmentalists are definitely not going to like either of these. Well… desperate times call for desperate measures. That reminds me… I haven’t eaten breakfast yet…
The President immediately stood up and bolted out the door.
“...”
The Secretary of Energy looked at everyone in the cabinet room.
“... what was that about…?”
Everyone looked at each other and shrugged.',
